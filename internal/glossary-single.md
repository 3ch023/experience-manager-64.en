## Glossary Single Term

If a user has a solution account, it is automatically linked (using the email ID) with the user's Adobe ID when the user accesses the solution from the Marketing Cloud. **Ambiguous user accounts with same email:** If solution users share an email, or if the system finds two solution accounts, automatic account linking cannot occur. In this scenario, when the users attempt to access a solution, they are presented with the option to manually link their solution account credentials with their Adobe ID. (The solution is available in MAC after group mapping.)
