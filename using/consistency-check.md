# Consistency and Traversal Checks

When upgrading there can be problems due to workspace inconsistencies. You can either run a test upgrade to see if this will be an issue, or run the consistency checks as preventive action.

If you run a test upgrade that fails due to workspace inconsistencies you will see entries similar to the following in crx-quickstart/logs/crx/error.log:

```xml
*ERROR* TarPersistenceManager: No bundle found for uuid 'deadbeef-cafe-babe-cafe-babecafebabe'
 ...
*ERROR* RepositoryImpl: Failed to initialize workspace 'crx.default'
javax.jcr.RepositoryException: Error indexing workspace: Error indexing workspace: Error indexing workspace
...
```

### Perform a Consistency Check

To perform a consistency check, navigate to the administration page for the JMX Mbean** com.adobe.granite (Repository)**. From the AEM main screen, go to:

**Tools &gt; Web Console &gt; Main(on menu bar) &gt; JMX &gt; com.adobe.granite (Repository)**

On a default installation, it is found here: ** [|Show Me|](http://localhost:4502/system/console/jmx/com.adobe.granite%3Atype%3DRepository)**

In the **Operations** section of the page you will find two methods: ** `traversalCheck`** and ** `consistencyCheck`**. To execute a check, click on the operation and enter the desired parameters.
