## Projects
The Screens Projects console is available by selecting the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left) and then Screens.

Alternatively, you can ï»¿go directly to: [http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens](http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens) 
![](assets/chlimage_1.png)The Screens project is the top node of your project. Different projects could be differents brands, deployments, customers, and so on.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   ><p>By default, the initial structure will contain the Applications, Channels, Devices and Locations master pages, but this can be manually adjusted if needed.</p>

The project is created and it brings you back to the Screens Project console. You can now select your project.

In a project, there are four kind of folders:

* Applications
* Locations
* Channels
* Devices

## Applications
The applications console allows you to preview the applications built for AEM Screens that will run on your display.
![](assets/chlimage_1.png)For example, you can navigate to [http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens/geometrixx/apps]( http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens/geometrixx/apps) and select the **Preview **icon of the **Geometrixx Virtual Showroom Experience**.

The preview of the application should open in a new tab.

## Locations
The locations host the configuration of the displays according to where the various screens are.
![](assets/chlimage_1.png)For an example of a configuration, navigate to [http://localhost:4502/screens/dashboard/display.html/content/screens/geometrixx/locations/demo/flagship/dual](http://localhost:4502/screens/dashboard/display.html/content/screens/geometrixx/locations/demo/flagship/dual).
![](assets/chlimage_1.png)In the **Devices/Screens** section you see:

* What AEM Screens Player hardware and software is running. The heartbeat is active if the player is running. The version shown is the Firmware version. If a newer version is available on the server, there is an option to update the Firmware on the AEM Screens Player.
* The **eye icon** allows to play the content of the device on your local browser ("browser" or "web" version of the Firmware)
* The **camera icon** allows to create a remote screenshot.

**Assigned Channels** shows how the content is getting assigned to Displays. If you click the **pencil** icon of one channel, you'll see: 
![](assets/chlimage_1.png)You can configure:

* **Role**: any name
* **Channel**: browse one of the channels created
* **Supported Events**

    * **Initial Load**: will load this channel when the player is started. It can be assigned to multiple in combination with schedule    
    * **Idle Screen**: is loaded when the screen is idle. It can be assigned to multiple in combination with schedule    
    * **Timer**: needs to be set when a schedule is provided    
    * **User Interaction**: will be loaded when the screen is touched

* **Schedule**: you can describe in text when the channel should appear. See [http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text](http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text) to know how to write.
* **Show Attraction Tooltip**: defines if the attraction tooltip ("Touch anywhere to begin") must be shown or not while the channel is running
