# Device Control Center

This section shows the different consoles available and how to achieve basic actions.

## Projects
The Screens Projects console is available by selecting the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left) and then Screens.

Alternatively, you can ï»¿go directly to: [http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens](http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens)

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1.png)

The Screens project is the top node of your project. Different projects could be differents brands, deployments, customers, and so on.

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-1.png)

To create a new Screens project:

1. Tap/click **Create**, a wizard will open.  

1. Select the required template and tap/click **Next**.

   ![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-2.png)

1. Enter the properties as required and tap/click **Create**.

   ![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-3.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >By default, the initial structure will contain the Applications, Channels, Devices and Locations master pages, but this can be manually adjusted if needed.

The project is created and it brings you back to the Screens Project console. You can now select your project.

In a project, there are four kind of folders:

* Applications
* Locations
* Channels
* Devices

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-4.png)

## Applications
The applications console allows you to preview the applications built for AEM Screens that will run on your display.

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-5.png)

For example, you can navigate to [http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens/geometrixx/apps]( http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens/geometrixx/apps) and select the **Preview **icon of the **Geometrixx Virtual Showroom Experience**.

The preview of the application should open in a new tab.

## Locations
The locations host the configuration of the displays according to where the various screens are.

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-6.png)

For an example of a configuration, navigate to [http://localhost:4502/screens/dashboard/display.html/content/screens/geometrixx/locations/demo/flagship/dual](http://localhost:4502/screens/dashboard/display.html/content/screens/geometrixx/locations/demo/flagship/dual).

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-7.png)

In the **Devices/Screens** section you see:

* What AEM Screens Player hardware and software is running. The heartbeat is active if the player is running. The version shown is the Firmware version. If a newer version is available on the server, there is an option to update the Firmware on the AEM Screens Player.
* The **eye icon** allows to play the content of the device on your local browser ("browser" or "web" version of the Firmware)
* The **camera icon** allows to create a remote screenshot.

**Assigned Channels** shows how the content is getting assigned to Displays. If you click the **pencil** icon of one channel, you'll see:

![](assets/device-control-center/chlimage_1-8.png)

You can configure:

* **Role**: any name
* **Channel**: browse one of the channels created
* **Supported Events**

    * **Initial Load**: will load this channel when the player is started. It can be assigned to multiple in combination with schedule
    * **Idle Screen**: is loaded when the screen is idle. It can be assigned to multiple in combination with schedule
    * **Timer**: needs to be set when a schedule is provided
    * **User Interaction**: will be loaded when the screen is touched

* **Schedule**: you can describe in text when the channel should appear. See [http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text](http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text) to know how to write.

* **Show Attraction Tooltip**: defines if the attraction tooltip ("Touch anywhere to begin") must be shown or not while the channel is running

>By default, changes made here are live instantly.
