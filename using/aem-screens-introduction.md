# What is AEM Screens?

## What is AEM Screens?
**AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) Screens** - *a Digital Signage Solution *that allows you to publish dynamic and interactive digital experiences and interactions involving different types of screens in conjunction with a comprehensive digital marketing platform.

Get up and running with a simple digital signage experience, using [Kickstart for AEM Screens](kickstart-for-aem-screens.md).

### Overview
**AEM Screens** is built on the solid foundation of ***AEM Sites ***and enables marketers and IT personnel to create and manage experiences on multiple digital screens that impact in-store/in-venue goals for building brand and driving demand. Integration of AEM Screens with Sites allows you to re-use already existing content and effectively deliver a coherent and consistent customer solution. This provides a streamlined workflow to create dedicated digital experiences that are highly cost-effective and usable. It further helps to influence brand perception and impact decisions leading to upliftment in purchase and engagement.

AEM Screens is a powerful web-based solution that allows you to create dedicated digital menu boards, product recommenders, background lifestyle imagery to expand customer interaction and deliver unified and useful brand experiences into physical venues, such as stores, hotels, banks, healthcare and educational instituitions, and many more - from the same AEM platform. Screens provides many unique applications such as interactive displays, wayfinding, branding, and adding ambience to your environment for customers and employees based on the domain where these are deployed.

Creating and managing an application using Screens is simple and intuitive. An *application* hosts web pages built for AEM Screens by customers or implementation partners. *Locations* manage pre-defined hierarchy and contains *displays*. Each display has a dashboard that shows different devices and screens attached. Content for AEM Screens is managed in *channels*. AEM Screens Player renders content present within channels onto displays.

*To understand the key terminologies associated with AEM Screens, see [Glossary](screens-glossary.md).*
