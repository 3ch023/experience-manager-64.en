# Digital River

Deploying the necessary eCommerce packages will provide the full functionality of the eCommerce framework, together with a reference implementation of eCommerce functionality as provided with a Digital River implementation (including a demonstration catalog based on We.Retail).

This catalog is available under the Language Masters English branch ( `/content/we-retal/language-masters/en`) of the We.Retail site.

## Prerequisites

You will need to reach out to your Digital River Account Manager to get an API key, Secret, and Endpoint. The connector wonâ€™t work without these.

## Installation of eCommerce with Digital River
