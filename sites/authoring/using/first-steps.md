# First Steps for Authors{#first-steps-for-authors}

This section gives you an overview of the main tasks that you will be using when [starting to author content](../../authoring/using/author.md#conceptofauthoringandpublishing) with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

It covers:

* [Getting Started](#gettingstarted)  
  Detailing the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.  

* [Further Actions](#furtheractions)  
  Following on with the many other actions you can use when authoring.

## Overview {#overview}

This slideshow (click-through) gives a quick visual overview of using AEM to author your first page. Links to details about the individual steps involved are then provided under [Getting Started](#gettingstarted).

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

These detail the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.

### Navigating to the Page Location {#navigating-to-the-page-location}

The content in your website is held in a tree-structure. To create or edit a page you need to [navigate to the location](../../authoring/using/basic-handling.md#main-pars-title-14).

### Creating a New Page {#creating-a-new-page}

Before editing, you need to [create a new page](../../authoring/using/managing-pages.md#main-pars-title-0).

### Opening a Page {#opening-a-page}

For many actions, such as editing, you need to [open a page](../../authoring/using/managing-pages.md#main-pars-title-6).

### Editing a Page {#editing-a-page}

Whether your instance already has existing pages or you have just created a new page yourself you can [edit a page](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md) by:

* [Inserting a Component (Paragraph)](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-2)
* [Edit/Configure/Copy/Cut/Delete/Paste](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-32) a Component
* [Edit (Content)](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-12)
* [Edit (Content) - Full Screen Mode](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-31)  

* [Undoing and Redoing Page Edits](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-19)
* [Using Preview Mode](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-196884421) (to see how it will look when published)
* [Locking a Page](../../authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-13)

### Publishing a Page {#publishing-a-page}

Once you have finished editing your page you will want to [publish (or activate) your page](../../authoring/using/publishing-pages.md#main-pars-title-10) so that it is available to visitors to your website.

## Further Actions {#further-actions}

After the basic steps there are many other actions you can use when authoring.

### Copying a Page {#copying-a-page}

It is sometimes easier to [copy a page](../../authoring/using/managing-pages.md#main-pars-title-7) and re-use the content rather than creating everything from scratch again.

### Moving or Renaming a Page {#moving-or-renaming-a-page}

[Moving and renaming pages](../../authoring/using/managing-pages.md#main-pars-title-8) is basically done with the same action.

### Unpublishing a Page {#unpublishing-a-page}

To make previously published (or activated) content unavailable on your public website, you [unpublish (or deactivate) the page](../../authoring/using/publishing-pages.md#main-pars-title-5).

### Deleting a Page {#deleting-a-page}

If a page is no longer needed you might want to [delete the page](../../authoring/using/managing-pages.md#main-pars-title-9).

### Setting the Page Properties {#setting-the-page-properties}

Every [page has properties](../../authoring/using/editing-page-properties.md) that you can define to determine aspects of its operation. These can be updated with either UI.

### Creating a Version of a Page {#creating-a-version-of-a-page}

You can [create a version](../../authoring/using/working-with-page-versions.md#main-pars-title-0) of a page and then [revert to a version](../../authoring/using/working-with-page-versions.md#revertingtoapageversion) if necessary.

## More Information {#more-information}

Access to more information about authoring can be found under [Page Authoring](../../authoring/using/page-authoring.md) and [Working with the Author Environment](../../authoring/using/author-environment.md).
