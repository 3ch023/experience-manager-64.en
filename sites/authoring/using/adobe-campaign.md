# Working with Adobe Campaign{#working-with-adobe-campaign}

Adobe Campaign is a set of solutions that lets you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels.

This documentation describes how to work with Adobe Campaign:

* Adobe Campaign 6.1, which is the on-premise solution. 
* Adobe Campaign Standard, which is the subscription-based solution.

See the following:

* [Working with Adobe Campaign 6.1 and Adobe Campaign Standard](../../authoring/using/campaign.md)
* [Adobe Campaign Components](../../authoring/using/adobe-campaign-components.md)
* [Creating Adobe Campaign Forms in AEM](../../authoring/using/adobe-campaign-forms.md)
* [Targeting your Adobe Campaign](../../authoring/using/target-adobe-campaign.md)

You must previously have [integrated AEM with Adobe Campaign](../../administering/using/campaign.md).

In addition, if you want to customize your integrations, see the following topics:

* [Creating Custom Extensions](../../developing/using/extending-campaign-extensions.md)
* [Creating Custom Form Mappings](../../developing/using/extending-campaign-form-mapping.md)
