<p>I've canceled inheritance at the page level as this feature is removed in 6.3.</p>

The Site Importer has been removed in AEM 6.3. It is available on Package Share when downloading the geometrixx sample pack. See the [AEM 6.2 documentation](../../developing/using/site-importer.md) for information on using this feature.
