<p>https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/CQDOC-11638</p>
<p>conventions to be respected when developing social variations - and the components to be used:</p>
<p>Hardcoded node properties:<br /> <strong>fileReference</strong>, <strong>fileName</strong> - for extracting image<br /> <strong>text</strong> - for extracting text</p>
<p>Components which do NOT use this convention will not be taken into consideration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ideea under it is that after you create a master variation, you can also create social variations (trim some text, remove some images, etc.)</p>
<p>Related to the last issue, to give a but more context:</p>
<p>· Social variants can be posted on social media (text and image).</p>
<p>· The social variants in AEM can contain any components (text components, image components, etc.)</p>
<p>· In order to poste the correct text and image to the social media network, some conventions need to be respected if custom components are built by customers.</p>
<p>- For text components the text must be saved as a property called `<strong>text</strong> ` on the component.</p>
<p>- For image components the image must be saved as a `<strong>fileReference</strong>` or `<strong>fileName</strong>` on the component.</p>
<p> </p>
