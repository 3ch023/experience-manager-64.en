# Managing Projects with the Touch-Enabled UI{#managing-projects-with-the-touch-enabled-ui}

Projects lets you organize your project by grouping resources into one entity.

In the **Projects** console, you access and take action on your projects.

>Projects are not available in classic UI. See [Projects](../../authoring/using/projects.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
