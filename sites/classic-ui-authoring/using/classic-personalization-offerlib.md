# Creating and Managing Offers{#creating-and-managing-offers}

Use the Offers console to create offers that you can [use in activity experiences](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-content-targeting-touch.md). Creating offers in the Offers console saves time when several experiences require the same offer:

* Create the offer once in the library and use it in multiple experieces of your brand activities. 
* Change the offer in the library and the change affects all of the experiences that use it.

The Offers console organizes offers by brand. Each brand contains a library of offers that can be used in a brand's experiences. Use folders to define a heirarchical structure for organizing offers in each library. A logical folder structure enables authors to easily find offers by browsing. Tagging and search tools also enable authors to find offers.

>[!NOTE]

>The offers console is not available in classic UI. See [Creating and Managing Offers](../../authoring/using/offerlib.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
