# First Steps for Authors{#first-steps-for-authors}

This section gives you an overview of the main tasks that you will be using when [starting to author content](../../authoring/using/author.md#conceptofauthoringandpublishing) with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

It covers:

* [Getting Started](#gettingstarted)  
  Detailing the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.  

* [Further Actions](#furtheractions)  
  Following on with the many other actions you can use when authoring.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

These detail the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.

### Navigating to the Page Location {#navigating-to-the-page-location}

The content in your website is held in a tree-structure. To create or edit a page you need to navigate to the location with the [Websites Console](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/author-env-basic-handling.md#main-pars-title-7).

### Creating a New Page {#creating-a-new-page}

Before editing, you need to [create a new page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-manage-pages.md#main-pars-title-qlklrx-refd).

### Opening a Page {#opening-a-page}

For many actions, such as editing, you need to [open a page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-manage-pages.md#main-pars-title-5-nywjma-refd).

### Editing a Page {#editing-a-page}

Whether your instance already has existing pages or you have just created a new page yourself you can [edit a page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md) by:

* [Inserting a Component (Paragraph)](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-5-gdvngq-refd)
* [Editing a Component](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-7-adkyem-refd)
* [Moving a Component](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-8-umkkve-refd)
* [Deleting a Component](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-9-hpunvg-refd)
* [Cut/Copy/Paste a Component](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-29)
* [Undoing and Redoing Page Edits](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-10-bslhyy-refd)
* [Using Preview Mode](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-10) (to see how it will look when published)
* [Locking a Page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-5)
* [Unlocking a Page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#main-pars-title-11)

### Publishing a Page {#publishing-a-page}

Once you have finished editing your page you will want to [publish (or activate) your page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-publish-pages.md#main-pars-title-10) so that it is available to visitors to your website.

## Further Actions {#further-actions}

In addition to the basic steps there are many other actions available when authoring.

### Copying a Page {#copying-a-page}

It is sometimes easier to [copy a page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-manage-pages.md#main-pars-title-4-jzkzny-refd) and re-use the content rather than creating everything from scratch again.

### Moving or Renaming a Page {#moving-or-renaming-a-page}

[Moving and renaming pages](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-manage-pages.md#main-pars-title-1-lgcpte-refd) is basically done with the same action.

### Unpublishing a Page {#unpublishing-a-page}

To make previously published (or activated) content unavailable on your public website, you [unpublish (or deactivate) the page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-publish-pages.md#main-pars-title-6).

### Deleting a Page {#deleting-a-page}

If a page is no longer needed you might want to [delete the page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-manage-pages.md#main-pars-title-2-yjepps-refd).

### Setting the Page Properties {#setting-the-page-properties}

Every [page has properties](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-page-properties.md) that you can define to determine aspects of its operation.

### Creating a Version of a Page {#creating-a-version-of-a-page}

You can [create a version of a page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-work-with-versions.md#creatinganewversion) and then [revert back to a version](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-work-with-versions.md#restoringapageversionfromsidekick) if necessary.

## More Information {#more-information}

Access to more information about authoring can be found under [Page Authoring](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author.md) and [Working with the Author Environment](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/author-env.md).
