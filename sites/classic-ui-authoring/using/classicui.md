# Authoring in the Classic UI{#authoring-in-the-classic-ui}

## Classic UI and Touch-Based UI {#classic-ui-and-touch-based-ui}

The Classic UI is the desktop-oriented user interface that as been available since CQ5. The following documentation on authoring is focused on this UI.

The touch-based UI is the new standard user interface for AEM, designed for use on both touch and desktop devices. Please see the [standard authoring documentation](../../authoring/using/author.md) for further information.
