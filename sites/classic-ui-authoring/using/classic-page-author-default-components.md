# Components{#components}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) comes with a variety of out-of-the-box components that provide comprehensive functionality for website authors. They are available when [editing a page](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-content.md) and are grouped by main functional area (i.e. component group) to aid filtering.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This section only discusses components that are available out-of-the-box in a standard AEM installation.
>
>Depending on your instance you may have customized components developed explicitly for your requirements. These may even have the same name as some of the components discussed here.

## Components - Major Areas {#components-major-areas}

The following pages provide fast links to some of the major areas of content management (links to further areas are given on the overview page above):

* [Components for Page Authoring](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-edit-mode.md)  
  Components used for creating standard page content are primarily contained in the groups **General**, **Columns** and **Forms**.

* [Communities](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-communities.md)  
  Components found in the **Communities** component group provide interactive features for a website, such as forums and comments. Many of these components are included when a [Community Site](/content/help/en/experience-manager/6-4/communities/using/overview) is created.

* [eCommerce](../../administering/using/ecommerce.md)  
  The eCommerce functionality within AEM also includes a range of components, contained in the **Commerce** group. Actual use can depend on the commerce engine being used.

## Using Design Mode to Configure Components {#using-design-mode-to-configure-components}

In addition to the components that authors can access through the sidekick in a standard installation, various other components are also available. You can use [Design mode](../../classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-page-author-design-mode.md#main-pars-title) to enable/disable these and edit parameters for specific components.
