# eCommerce{#ecommerce}

The integration framework includes an integration layer with an API. This allows you to:

* plug in an eCommerce system and pull product data into AEM
* build AEM components for commerce capabilities independent of the specific eCommerce engine

For more information, see:

* [Developing (generic)](../../../sites/developing/using/generic.md)
* [Developing with hybris](../../../sites/developing/using/hybris.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Since the eCommerce framework can be used with any eCommerce solution, see [Developing (generic)](../../../sites/developing/using/generic.md) for more information about developing possibilities with Intershop, Elastic Path or IBM Websphere Commerce.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To use the integration framework with external eCommerce providers, you first need to install the required packages. For more information, see [Deploying eCommerce](../../../sites/deploying/using/ecommerce.md).
>
>For information about concepts and administering eCommerce implementations, see [Administering eCommerce](../../../sites/administering/using/ecommerce.md).

See the [API documentation](/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/index) for further information.
