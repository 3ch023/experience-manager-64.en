 <body> 
  <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has become a key concern for many marketers. As a result, SEO concerns need to be addressed on many AEM projects.</p> 
  <p>This document first describes some <a href="#seobestpractices">SEO best practices</a> and recommendations for achieving these on an AEM implementation. Then, this document takes a deeper dive into some of the more <a href="#aemconfigurations">complex implementation steps</a> raised in the first section.</p> 
  <h2>SEO Best Practices</h2> 
  <p>This section describes some general SEO best practices.</p> 
  <h3>URLs</h3> 
  <p>There are some generally accepted best practices when it comes to URLs.</p> 
  <p>In your AEM project, when evaluating your URLs, ask yourself the following:</p> 
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“If a user were to see this URL and none of the content on the page, could they describe what this page was?”</p> 
  <p>If the answer is yes, then it is likely that the URL will work well for a search engine.</p> 
  <p>Here are some general tips on how to construct your URLs for SEO:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Use hyphens to separate words.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Name pages using hyphens (-) as separators. </li> 
     <li>Avoid using camel case, underscores, and spaces.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Avoid the use of query parameters when possible. When necessary, limit them to two or less.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Use the directory structure to indicate information architecture, when available.</li> 
     <li>If a directory structure is not an option, make use of Sling selectors in the URL rather than query strings. In addition to the SEO value that they provide, sling selectors will also make the pages cacheable for the dispatcher.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>The more human-readable a URL is, the better; having keywords present in the URL will boost value.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>When using selectors on a page, selectors that provide semantic value are preferred.</li> 
     <li>If a human cannot read your URL, a search engine cannot either.</li> 
     <li>For example:<br /> <span class="code">mybrand.com/products/product-detail.product-category.product-name.html </span><br /> is preferred to <span class="code">mybrand.com/products/product-detail.1234.html</span> </li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Avoid subdomains whenever possible, as search engines will treat them as different entities, fragmenting the SEO value of the site.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Instead use first-level sub paths. For example, instead of <span class="code">es.mybrand.com/home.html</span>, use <span class="code">www.mybrand.com/es/home.html</span>.</li> 
     <li>Plan your content hierarchy to match the way that the content will be presented, according to this guideline.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Keyword effectiveness in URLs decreases as the length of the URL and the position of the keyword increases. In other words, shorter is better.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Use URL shortening techniques and features provided by AEM to remove unnecessary URL pieces. </li> 
     <li>For example, <span class="code">mybrand.com/en/myPage.html</span> is preferred to <span class="code">mybrand.com/content/my-brand/en/myPage.html</span>.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Use canonical URLs.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>When a URL can be served from different paths or with different parameters or selectors, make sure to use a<strong> </strong><span class="code">rel=canonical</span> tag on the page. </li> 
     <li>This can be included in the code for the AEM template.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Match URLs to page titles whenever possible.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Content authors should be encouraged to follow this practice.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Support case insensitivity in URL requests.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Configure the dispatcher to rewrite all inbound requests as lowercase letters. </li> 
     <li>Train content authors to create all pages using lowercase letters.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Make sure that each page is only served from one protocol.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Sometimes sites will be served over <span class="code">http</span> until a user reaches a page with, for example, a checkout or login form, at which point it switches to <span class="code">https</span>. When linking from this page, if the user can return to <span class="code">http</span> pages and access them through <span class="code">https</span>, the search engine will track these as two separate pages.</li> 
     <li>Google currently prefers <span class="code">https</span> pages to <span class="code">http</span> ones. For this reason it often makes everyone’s life easier to serve the whole site over <span class="code">https</span>.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Server configuration</h3> 
  <p>In terms of server configuration, you can take the following steps to ensure that only the correct content is being crawled:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Use a <span class="code">robots.txt</span> file to block crawling of any content that should not be indexed. 
    <ul> 
     <li>Block <strong>all</strong> crawling on test environments.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>When launching a new site with updated URLs, implement 301 redirects to ensure that your existing SEO ranking is not lost.</li> 
   <li>Include a favicon for your site.</li> 
   <li>Implement an XML sitemap to make it easier for search engines to crawl your content. Make sure to include a mobile sitemap for mobile and/or responsive sites.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>AEM Configurations</h2> 
  <p>This section describes the implementation steps needed configure AEM to follow these SEO recommendations. </p> 
  <h3>Using Sling selectors</h3> 
  <p>Previously, using query parameters was the generally accepted practice when building an enterprise web application.</p> 
  <p>The trend in recent years has been to remove these in an effort to make URLs more readable. On many platforms, this involves implementing redirects on the web server or Content Delivery Network (CDN), but Sling makes this straightforward. Sling selectors:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Improve URL readability.</li> 
   <li>Let you cache your pages on the dispatcher and will often improve security. </li> 
   <li>Allow you to address the content directly, rather than having a generic servlet that retrieves content. This grants you the benefits of ACLs that you apply to your repository and filters that you apply on the dispatcher.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Using selectors for servlets</h4> 
  <p>AEM provides us with two options when writing servlets:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>bin</strong> servlets</li> 
   <li><strong>Sling</strong> servlets</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The following examples illustrate how to register servlets that follow both of these patterns as well as the benefit gained by using Sling servlets.</p> 
  <h4>Bin servlets (one level down)</h4> 
  <p><strong>Bin</strong> servlets follow the pattern that many developers are used to from J2EE programming. The servlet is registered at a specific path, which in the case of AEM is usually under <span class="code">/bin</span>, and you extract the needed request parameters from the query string.</p> 
  <p>The SCR annotation for this type of servlet would look something like this:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax js">
    @SlingServlet(paths&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"/bin/myApp/myServlet",&amp;nbsp;extensions&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"json",&amp;nbsp;methods&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"GET") 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>You then extract the parameters from the query string via the <span class="code">SlingHttpServletRequest</span> object that is included in the <span class="code">doGet</span> method; for example:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax js">
    String&amp;nbsp;myParam&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;req.getParameter("myParam");!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>The resulting URL used would look something like this:</p> 
  <p><span class="code">http://www.mydomain.com/bin/myApp/myServlet.json?myParam=myValue</span></p> 
  <p>There are a few points to be considered with this approach:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The URL itself loses SEO value. Users accessing the site, including search engines, do not receive any semantic value from the URL, as the URL represents a programmatic path and not the content hierarchy.</li> 
   <li>The presence of query parameters in the URL means that the dispatcher will not be able to cache the response.</li> 
   <li>If you want to secure this servlet, you need to implement your own custom security logic in the servlet.</li> 
   <li>The dispatcher must be configured (carefully) to expose <span class="code">/bin/myApp/myServlet</span>. Simply exposing <span class="code">/bin</span> would allow access to certain servlets that should not be open to site visitors.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Sling servlets (one level down)</h4> 
  <p><strong>Sling</strong> servlets let you register your servlet in the opposite manner. Rather than addressing a servlet and specifying the content you would like the servlet to render based on the query parameters, you address the content that you want and specify the servlet that should render the content based on Sling selectors.</p> 
  <p>The SCR annotation for this type of servlet would look something like this:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax js">
    @SlingServlet(resourceTypes&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"myBrand/components/pages/myPageType",&amp;nbsp;selectors&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"myRenderer",&amp;nbsp;extensions&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"json”,&amp;nbsp;methods=”GET”)!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>In this case, the resource that the URL addresses (an instance of the <span class="code">myPageType</span> resource) is accessible in the servlet automatically. To access it, you call:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax js">
    Resource&amp;nbsp;myPage&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;req.getResource(); 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>The resulting URL used would look something like this:</p> 
  <p><span class="code">http://www.mydomain.com/content/my-brand/my-page.myRenderer.json</span></p> 
  <p>The benefits to this approach are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>You can bake in the SEO value, gained by the semantics present in your site hierarchy and page name.</li> 
   <li>Since no query parameters are present, the dispatcher can cache the response. Additionally, any updates made to the addressed page will invalidate this cache when the page is activated.</li> 
   <li>All ACLs applied to <span class="code">/content/my-brand/my-page</span> will come into effect when a user tries to access this servlet.</li> 
   <li>The dispatcher will already be configured to serve this content as a function of serving the website. No additional configuration is required.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>URL rewriting</h3> 
  <p>In AEM, all of your web pages are stored under <span class="code">/content/my-brand/my-content</span>. While this may be useful from the perspective of repository data management, it is not necessarily how you want your customers to see your site and may conflict with the SEO guidance to keep URLs as short as possible. Additionally, you may be serving multiple websites from the same AEM instance and from different domain names. </p> 
  <p>This section reviews the options available in AEM for managing these URLs and presenting them to users in a more readable and SEO-friendly manner.</p> 
  <h4>Vanity URLs</h4>   
  <p>If an author wants a page to be accessible from a second location for promotional purposes, AEM's vanity URLs, defined on a page-by-page basis, might be useful. To add a vanity URL for a page, navigate to it in the <strong>Sites</strong> console and edit the page properties. At the bottom of the <strong>Basic</strong> tab, you see a section where vanity URLs can be added. Keep in mind that having the page accessible via more than one URL will fragment the SEO value of the page, so a canonical URL tag should be added to the page to avoid this issue.</p> 
  <h4>Localized page names</h4> 
  <p>You may want to to display localized page names to users of translated content. For example:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Rather than having a Spanish-speaking user navigate to:<br /> <span class="code">www.mydomain.com/es/home.html</span></li> 
   <li>It would be better for the URL to be:<br /> <span class="code">www.mydomain.com/es/casa.html</span>. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The challenge with localizing the name of the page is that many of the localization tools available on the AEM platform rely on having the page names match across locales in order to keep the content synchronized.</p> 
  <p>The <span class="code">sling:alias</span> property allows you to have our cake and eat it too. <span class="code">sling:alias</span> can be added as a property to any resource to allow for an alias name for the resource. In the previous example, you would have:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A page in the JCR at:<br /> <span class="code">…/es/home</span></li> 
   <li>Then add a property to it:<br /> <span class="code">sling:alias</span> = <span class="code">casa</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This would allow the AEM translation tools such as the multi-site manager to continue to maintain a relationship between:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span class="code">/en/home</span><strong> </strong></li> 
   <li><span class="code">/es/home</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>While also allowing end users to interact with the page name in their native languages.</p> 
  <h4>/etc/map</h4> 
  <p>In a standard AEM installation:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>for the OSGi configuration <br /> <strong>Apache Sling Resource Resolver Factory</strong> <br /> (<span class="code">org.apache.sling.jcr.resource.internal.JcrResourceResolverFactoryImpl</span>)</li> 
   <li>the property<br /> <strong>Mapping Location</strong> (<span class="code">resource.resolver.map.location</span>)</li> 
   <li>defaults to <span class="code">/etc/map</span>.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Mapping definitions can be added in this location to map inbound requests, rewrite URLs on pages in AEM, or both.</p> 
  <p>To create a new mapping, create a new <span class="code">sling:Mapping</span><strong> </strong>node in this location under <span class="code">/http</span> or <span class="code">/https</span>. Based on the <span class="code">sling:match</span> and <span class="code">sling:internalRedirect</span> properties that are set on this node, AEM will redirect all traffic for the matched URL to the value specified in the <span class="code">internalRedirect</span> property.</p>  
  <p>While this is the approach that is documented in the official AEM and Sling documentation, the regular expression support provided by this implementation is limited in scope when compared to the options that are available to us by using the <span class="code">SlingResourceResolver</span> directly. Additionally, implementing mappings in this way can lead to issues with dispatcher cache invalidation.</p> 
  <p>Here is an example of how this issue occurs:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>A user visits your website and requests <span class="code">http://www.mydomain.com/my-page.html</span></li> 
   <li>The dispatcher forwards this request to the publish server.</li> 
   <li>Using <span class="code">/etc/map</span>, the publish server resolves this request to <span class="code">/content/my-brand/my-page</span> and renders the page.</li> 
   <li>The dispatcher caches the response at <span class="code">/my-page.html</span> and returns the response to the user.</li> 
   <li>A content author makes a change to this page and activates it.</li> 
   <li>The dispatcher flush agent sends an invalidation request for <span class="code">/content/my-brand/my-page</span><strong>.</strong> Because the dispatcher does not have a page cached at this path, the old content remains cached and will be stale.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>There are ways to configure custom dispatch-flush rules that will map the shorter URL to the longer URL for purposes of cache invalidation.</p> 
  <p>However, there is also a simpler way to manage this:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li> <p>Using the web console (for example, localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr) you can configure the Sling Resource Resolver:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Apache Sling Resource Resolver Factory</strong> <br /> <span class="code">(org.apache.sling.jcr.resource.internal.JcrResourceResolverFactoryImpl)</span>.</li> 
    </ul> <p>It is recommended that you build out the mappings required to shorten URLs as regular expressions, then define these configurations under an OsgiConfignode, <span class="code">config.publish</span>, that is included in your build.</p> <p>Rather than defining your mappings in <span class="code">/etc/map</span>, they can be assigned directly to the property <strong>URL Mappings</strong> (<span class="code">resource.resolver.mapping</span>):</p> 
    <codeblock class="syntax xml">
      resource.resolver.mapping="[/content/my-brand/(.*)&lt;/$1]" 
    </codeblock><p>In this simple example, you are removing <span class="code">/content/my-brand/</span> from the beginning of any URL where it is present.</p> <p>This would convert a URL:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>from <span class="code">/content/my-brand/my-page.html</span> </li> 
     <li>to just <span class="code">/my-page.html</span></li> 
    </ul> <p>This is in line with the recommended practice of keeping URLs as short as possible.</p> </li> 
   <li> <p>After you have defined your mappings in the Apache Sling Resource Resolver, you need to use these mappings in your components to ensure that the URLs you output on your pages are short and tidy. You can do this by using the map function of the <span class="code">ResourceResolver</span>.</p> <p>For example, if you were implementing a custom navigation component that lists out the children of the current page, you can use the mapping method like so:</p> 
    <codeblock class="syntax js">
      for&amp;nbsp;(Page&amp;nbsp;child&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;children)&amp;nbsp;{!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;String&amp;nbsp;childUrl&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;resourceResolver.map(request,&amp;nbsp;child.getPath());!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;//Output&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;childUrl&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;page&amp;nbsp;here!!discoiqbr!!}!!discoiqbr!! 
    </codeblock></li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Apache HTTP Server mod_rewrite</h4> 
  <p>So far, you have implemented mappings together with the logic in your components to use these mappings when outputting URLs onto our pages.</p> 
  <p>The final piece to the puzzle is handling these shortened URLs when they come in to the dispatcher, which is where <span class="code">mod_rewrite</span> comes into play. The biggest benefit to using <span class="code">mod_rewrite</span> is that the URLs are mapped back to their long form <i>before</i> they are sent to the dispatcher module. This means that the dispatcher will request the long URL from the publish server and cache it accordingly. Therefore, any dispatcher flush requests that come in from the publish server will be able to successfully invalidate this content.</p> 
  <p>To implement these rules, you can add <span class="code">RewriteRule</span> elements under your virtual host in the Apache HTTP Server configuration. If you want to expand the shortened URLs from the earlier example, you can implement a rule that looks like this:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax js">
    &lt;VirtualHost&amp;nbsp;*:80&gt;!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ServerName&amp;nbsp;www.mydomain.com!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RewriteEngine&amp;nbsp;on!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RewriteRule&amp;nbsp;^/(.*)$&amp;nbsp;/content/my-brand/$1&amp;nbsp;[PT,L]!!discoiqbr!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;…!!discoiqbr!!&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <h3>Canonical URL tags</h3> 
  <p>Canonical URL tags are link tags placed into the head of an HTML document to clarify how search engines should treat a page while indexing the content. The benefit they offer is to ensure that (different versions of) a page will be indexed as the same even when the URL to the page may contain differences. </p> 
  <p>For example, if a site were to offer a printer-friendly version of a page, a search engine would potentially index this page separately from the regular version of the page. The canonical tag will tell the search engine that they are the same.</p> 
  <p>Examples:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>http://www.mydomain.com/my-brand/my-page.html</li> 
   <li>http://www.mydomain.com/my-brand/my-page.print.html</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Both would apply the following tag to the head of the page:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax xml">
    &lt;link&amp;nbsp;rel=”canonical”&amp;nbsp;href=”my-brand/my-page.html”/&gt;!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>The <span class="code">href</span> can be relative or absolute. The code should be included in the page markup to determine the canonical URL for the page and output this tag. </p> 
  <h3>Configuring the dispatcher for case insensitivity</h3> 
  <p>The best practice is to serve all pages using lowercase letters. However, you do not want a user to get a 404 when they access your website using uppercase letters in their URL. For this reason, Adobe recommends that you add a rewrite rule in the Apache HTTP Server configuration to map all incoming URLs to lowercase. Additionally, content authors must be trained to create their pages with lowercase names.</p> 
  <p>To configure Apache to force all inbound traffic to lowercase, add the following to the <span class="code">vhost</span> config:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax xml">
    RewriteEngine&amp;nbsp;On&amp;nbsp;!!discoiqbr!!RewriteMap&amp;nbsp;lowercase&amp;nbsp;int:tolower!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>Additionally, add the following to the very top of the <span class="code">htaccess</span> file:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax xml">
    RewriteCond&amp;nbsp;$1&amp;nbsp;[A-Z]&amp;nbsp;!!discoiqbr!!RewriteRule&amp;nbsp;^(.*)$&amp;nbsp;/${lowercase:$1}&amp;nbsp;[R=301,L]!!discoiqbr!! 
  </codeblock> 
  <h3>Implementing robots.txt to protect development environments</h3> 
  <p>Search engines <i>should</i> check for the presence of a <span class="code">robots.txt</span> file at your site root before crawling your site. Should is emphasized here because while major search engines such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing all respect this, some foreign search engines do not. </p> 
  <p>The simplest way to block access to your entire site is to place a file named <span class="code">robots.txt</span> at the site root with the following content:</p> 
  <codeblock class="syntax xml">
    User-agent:&amp;nbsp;*!!discoiqbr!!Disallow:&amp;nbsp;/ 
  </codeblock> 
  <p>Alternately, on a live environment, you could choose to disallow certain paths that you do not want indexed. </p> 
  <p>The caveat with placing the <span class="code">robots.txt</span><strong> </strong>file at the site root is that dispatcher flush requests may clear this file out and URL mappings will likely place the site root somewhere different than the <span class="code">DOCROOT</span> as defined in the Apache HTTP Server configuration. For this reason, it is common to place this file on the author instance at the site root and replicate it to the publish instance.</p> 
  <h3>Building an XML sitemap on AEM</h3> 
  <p>Crawlers use XML sitemaps to better understand the structure of websites. While there is no guarantee that providing a sitemap will lead to improved SEO rankings, it is an agreed-upon best practice. You can manually maintain an XML file on the web server to use as the sitemap, but it is recommended to generate the sitemap programmatically, which ensures that as authors create new content, the sitemap will automatically reflect their changes.</p> 
  <p>To programmatically generate a sitemap, register a Sling Servlet listening for a <span class="code">sitemap.xml</span> call. The servlet can then use the resource provided via the servlet API to look at the current page and its children, outputting XML. The XML will then be cached at the dispatcher. This location should be referenced in the sitemap property of the<strong> </strong><span class="code">robots.txt</span> file. Additionally, a custom flush rule will need to be implemented to make sure to flush this file whenever a new page is activated.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>You can register a Sling Servlet to listen for the selector <span class="code">sitemap</span> with the extension <span class="code">xml</span>. This will cause the servlet to process the request any time a URL is requested that ends in:<br /> <span class="code">/&amp;lt;<i>path-to</i>&amp;gt;/page.sitemap.xml</span> </p> 
   <p>You can then get the requested resource from the request and generate a sitemap from that point in the content tree by using the JCR APIs.</p> 
   <p>The benefit to an approach like this is when you have multiple sites being served from the same instance. A request to <span class="code">/content/siteA.sitemap.xml</span> would generate a sitemap for <span class="code">siteA</span> while a request for <span class="code">/content/siteB.sitemap.xml</span> would generate a sitemap for <span class="code">siteB</span> without the need for writing additional code.</p>

  <h3>Creating 301 redirects for legacy URLs</h3> 
  <p>When launching a site with a new structure, implementing and testing 301 redirects in Apache HTTP Server is important for two reasons:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The legacy URLs have built up SEO value over time. By implementing a redirect, the search engine can apply this value to the new URL.</li> 
   <li>Users of your site may have created bookmarks to these pages. By implementing redirects, you can be sure to direct the user to the page on the new site that most closely matches where they were trying to get on the old site.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Make sure to check the additional resources section that follows for instructions on implementing 301 redirects as well as a tool to test that your redirects are working as expected.</p>
