# Working with Tasks{#working-with-tasks}

Tasks represent items of work to be done on content. When you are assigned a task, it appears in your Workflow Inbox. Task items have a value of task in the Type column.

Tasks are also used in projects to determine the level of completeness of current tasks, including workflow tasks.
