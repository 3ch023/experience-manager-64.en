# Delivering Dynamic Media Assets{#delivering-dynamic-media-assets}

How you can deliver your dynamic media assets - both video and images - depends on how your web site is implemented.

With Dynamic Media you have several options:

* If your website is hosted on AEM, then you want to add the dynamic media assets directly to your page. 
* If your website is not on AEM, then see [Delivering Dynamic Media Assets](../../../assets/using/delivering-dynamic-media-assets.md) in the touch-enabled user interface.

For more information, see the following topics:

* [Adding Dynamic Media Assets to Pages](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/dynamic-media-assets-adding-to-page.md)
