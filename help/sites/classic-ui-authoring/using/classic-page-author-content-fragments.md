# Page Authoring with Content Fragments{#page-authoring-with-content-fragments}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) content fragments are [created and managed as page-independent assets](../../../assets/using/content-fragments.md).

They allow you to create channel-neutral content, together with (possibly channel-specific) variations. You can then use these fragments, and their variations, when authoring your content pages.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The full functionality of Content Fragment Management is not available in classic UI. See [Page Authoring with Content Fragments](../../../sites/authoring/using/content-fragments.md) in the standard authoring documentation.
>
>The Content Fragment component can be seen in the classic UI sidekick, but further functions are not available.
