# Creating Page Templates{#creating-page-templates}

When creating a page you need to select a template; this will be used as the basis for creating the new page. The template defines the structure of the resultant page, any initial content and the components that can be used (design properties).

With the template editor, creating and maintaining templates is no longer a developer-only task. A power-author can be involved too. Developers are still required to setup the environment, create client libraries and create the components to be used, but once these basics are in place the author has the flexibility to create and configure templates without a development project or iteration.

The template console allows your (template) authors to:

* Create a new template (either new or by copying an existing template).  
* Manage the lifecycle of the template.

The template editor allows your (template) authors to:

* Add (available) components to the template and position them on a responsive grid.
* Pre-configure the components.  
* Define which components can be edited on the resultant pages (created from the template).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The **Templates** console and editor are only available with the touch-enabled UI. Pages and templates created with the **Templates** console are not meant to be used with the classic UI and such use is not supported. See [Creating Page Templates](../../../sites/authoring/using/templates.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
