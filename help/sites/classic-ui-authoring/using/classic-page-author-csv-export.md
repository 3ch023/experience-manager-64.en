# Export to CSV{#export-to-csv}

**Create CSV Export** enables you to export information about your pages to a CSV file on your local system.

* The file downloaded is called `export.csv`
* The contents are dependent on the properties you select.
* You can define the path together with the depth of the export.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The export feature is only available in the touch-optimized UI. See [Export to CSV](../../../sites/authoring/using/csv-export.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
