# Previewing Pages Using ContextHub Data{#previewing-pages-using-contexthub-data}

The [ContextHub](/help/sites/developing/using/contexthub.md) toolbar displays data from ContextHub stores and enables you to change store data. The ContextHub toolbar is useful for previewing content that is determined by data in a ContextHub store.

The toolbar consists of a series of UI modes that contain one or more UI modules.

* UI modes are icons that appear on the left hand side of the toolbar. When you click or tap an icon, the toolbar reveals the UI modules that it contains.
* UI modules display data from one or more ContextHub stores. Some UI modules also enable you to manipulate store data.

ContextHub installs several UI modes and UI modules. Your administrator may have [configured ContextHub](/help/sites/administering/using/contexthub-config.md) to display different ones.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The ContextHub toolbar is not available in classic UI. See [Previewing Pages Using ContextHub Data](/help/sites/authoring/using/ch-previewing.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
