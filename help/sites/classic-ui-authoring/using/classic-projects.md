# Projects{#projects}

Projects let you group resources into one entity. A common, shared environment makes it easy to manage your projects. The types of resources you can associate with a project are referred to in AEM as Tiles. Tiles may include project and team information, assets, workflows, and other types of information, as described in detail in [Project Tiles.](#projecttiles)

>Projects are not available in classic UI. See [Projects](../../../sites/authoring/using/projects.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
