# Authoring Targeted Content Using Targeting Mode{#authoring-targeted-content-using-targeting-mode}

Author targeted content using Targeting mode of AEM. Targeting mode and the Target component provide tools for creating content for experiences:

* Easily recognize the targeted content that is on the page. A dotted line forms a border around all targeted content. 
* Select a brand and an activity to see the experiences.
* Add experiences to an activity or remove experiences.
* Perform A/B testing and convert winners (Adobe Target only).
* Add offers to an experience by creating offers or using offers from a library.
* Configure goals and monitor performance.
* Simulate the user experience.
* For more customization, configure the Target component.

You can use either AEM or Adobe Target as the targeting engine (you must have a valid Adobe Target account to use Adobe Target). If you are using Adobe Target, you must configure the integration first.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Targeting mode is not available in classic UI. See [Authoring Targeted Content Using Targeted Mode](../../../sites/authoring/using/content-targeting-touch.md) in the standard authoring documentation for details.
