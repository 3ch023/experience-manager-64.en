# Best Practices{#best-practices}

Best practices describe how to develop, administer, or use AEM in the most efficient and most effective way possible. This growing list of topics includes a variety of areas in AEM.

The following areas have documentation available concerning best practices:

* [Assets](#assets)
* [Sites](#sites)

For best practices on authoring, deploying and maintaining, or developing, see one of the following:

* [Authoring best practices](../../../sites/authoring/using/best-practices.md)
* [Developing best practices](../../../sites/developing/using/best-practices.md)
* [Deploying best practices](../../../sites/deploying/using/best-practices.md)
