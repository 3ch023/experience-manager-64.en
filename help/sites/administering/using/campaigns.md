# Campaigns{#campaigns}

Campaign management provides digital marketers the opportunity to deliver personalized content and create dedicated experiences for visitors.

If you are administering campaigns (including landing pages) you may need to do the following:

* **Define segments** - You need to define segments and strategies for your targeted content.
* **Prepare HTML for landing pages** - Landing pages let authors import design and content right into an AEM page quickly and easily. You need to prepare the HTML so that assets can be properly imported. Landing pages are useful when creating marketing landing pages that are only active for a limited time and need to be created quickly.
* **Integrate with SiteCatalyst** - You can integrate landing pages with SiteCatalyst.
