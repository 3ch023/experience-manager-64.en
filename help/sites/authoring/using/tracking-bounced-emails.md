# Tracking Bounced Emails{#tracking-bounced-emails}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe will not further enhance E-mail tracking of open/bounces (not deliverable) sent by the AEM SMTP service.
>
>Adobe's recommendation is to [leverage Adobe Campaign and the integration to AEM](../../../sites/administering/using/campaign.md).

This feature is available in the classic user interface. See [Tracking Bounced Emails in the classic UI](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-campaigns-email-tracking-bounces.md).
