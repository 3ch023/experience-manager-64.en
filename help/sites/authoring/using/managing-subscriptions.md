Users can be asked to subscribe to **Email Service Provider's** mailing lists with the help of the** Form **component used on an AEM web page. To prepare an AEM page with a sign-up form for subscription to your e-mail service mailing lists, you must apply the corresponding service configuration to the AEM page that the potential subscriber will visit.

See [Managing Subscriptions in the classic user interface](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-campaigns-email-subscriptions.md) for more detailed descriptions of how to manage your subscriptions.
