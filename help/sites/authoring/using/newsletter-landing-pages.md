# Creating an Effective Newsletter Landing Page{#creating-an-effective-newsletter-landing-page}

An effective newsletter landing page helps you get as many people as possible to sign up for your newsletter (or other email marketing campaign). You can use the information you gather from your newsletter sign ups to get leads.

To create an effective newsletter landing page, you need to do the following:

1. Create a list for the newsletter so people can subscribe to the newsletter.
1. Create the Sign-Up form. When doing this, add a workflow step that automatically adds the person who signs up for the newsletter to your list of leads.
1. Create a Confirmation page that thanks users for signing up and possibly provides them with a promotion.
1. Add teasers.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe is not planning to further enhance this capability (Managing Leads and Lists).  
>Recommendation is to leverage [Adobe Campaign and the integration to AEM](../../../sites/administering/using/campaign.md).

See [Creating an Effective Newsletter Landing Page (classic user interface)](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-campaigns-email-landingpage.md) for more information.
