# Testing and Tracking Tools{#testing-and-tracking-tools}

#### Testing {#testing}

AEM provides:

* a [framework for testing component UI](../../../sites/developing/using/hobbes.md). 
* [a mechanism for testing and debugging components](../../../sites/developing/using/developer-mode.md).

The following are two Open Source Testing tools:

**Selenium**

**JMeter**

There are also many proprietary tools for automating tests and managing test plans.

#### Tracking {#tracking}

The following tools are easily available. However a key issue in all cases is the availability of the data to all members of the project team - partner and customer.

**Bugzilla**

**Spreadsheets**

Again there are many proprietary tools for tracking bugs and feature requirements.
