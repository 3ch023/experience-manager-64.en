# SPA WKND Tutorial{#spa-wknd-tutorial}

Immerse yourself in SPA development with this multi-part tutorial leading you through project setup, component mapping, front-end development tools, and application routing to implement your own SPA.

## Tutorials {#tutorials}

For an end-to-end example of building your own single-page application that is editable with AEM starting with project setup through application routing, see the [Getting Started with the AEM SPA Editor - WKND Events Tutorial](/content/help/en/experience-manager/kt/sites/using/getting-started-spa-wknd-tutorial-develop). There are versions of the tutorial for the React and Angular frameworks.

Before you begin your own SPA project for AEM however, be sure to also review the [Developing SPAs for AEM](../../../sites/developing/using/spa-architecture.md) document.
