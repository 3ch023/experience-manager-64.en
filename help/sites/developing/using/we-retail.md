# We.Retail Reference Implementation{#we-retail-reference-implementation}

## Introduction {#introduction}

![](/content/help/en/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/we-retail/_jcr_content/main-pars/image.img.jpg/screencapture-localhost-4502-editor-html-content-we-retail-us-en-html-2018-08-17-14_33_32.png)

We.Retail is a reference implementation and sample content that illustrates the recommended way of setting up an online presence with Adobe Experience Manager.

We.Retail makes use of the latest AEM technologies such as HTL, responsive layouts, editable templates, core components, and much more.

While it illustrates a retail vertical, the way the site is setup can be applied to any vertical, and only the product catalog and cart features are retail-specific.

## Features {#features}

As AEM's standard reference implementation, We.Retail showcases some of the most powerful features of AEM.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

We.Retail is delivered as AEM's sample content. In order to use, simply [start AEM as you normally would](../../../sites/deploying/using/deploy.md#getting-started), making sure that sample content is not disabled.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>We.Retail should not be installed on production instances. Production instances should be started in `nosamplecontent` [runmode](../../../sites/deploying/using/configure-runmodes.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>We.Retail is based on the latest AEM technology and therefore does not support [classic UI authoring](/sites/classic-ui-authoring/user-guide.md).

### Latest Version {#latest-version}

Although We.Retail is distributed with the AEM release, updates to the content and its features may be made after the release. Therefore it is possible to [download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-sample-we-retail/releases) and then [upload](../../../sites/administering/using/package-manager.md#uploading-packages-from-your-file-system) and [install](../../../sites/administering/using/package-manager.md#installing-packages) it as a package on your AEM instance.

### First Steps {#first-steps}

1. Once AEM is started (and/or We.Retail is installed), the site **We.Retail** is available in the [sites console](../../../sites/authoring/using/basic-handling.md#global-navigation).
1. For example the following page can be opened and it should look as displayed in the [appendix](#appendix) below:

   `https://<server name>:<port number>/editor.html/content/we-retail/language-masters/en.html`

## We.Retail & Geometrixx {#we-retail-geometrixx}

Geometrixx and its many incarnations served as sample content in earlier versions of AEM. Since version 6.3, We.Retail has been the sample content delivered with AEM and serves as the new standard reference implementation.

We.Retail is technically more robust and exploits the latest AEM technology to be more flexible and scalable, while also demonstrating the newest features of the product.

### Feature Comparison {#feature-comparison}

The following table gives an overview of major features that are available in We.Retail as compared to Geometrixx.

* **Available** means that examples of the feature are found in the sample content.
* **Not available** means that examples of the feature are not available in the sample content, but does not mean that the feature itself is not.
