# Quickstart for AEM Screens{#quickstart-for-aem-screens}

This section is a quickstart to AEM Screens and shows how to achieve basic actions. It walks you through setting up a basic digital signage experience with content/assets and publishing to a screens player. For in-depth understanding of all the components for Screens development, see the resources at the end of the page.
