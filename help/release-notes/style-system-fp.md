# Style FP {#style-fp}

The Style System allows a template author to define style classes in the component policy of components so that a content author can select these when editing the component on a page. These styles can be visual variations of the component, allowing better component reuse.

This eliminates the need to develop a custom component for each style or customize the component dialog to enable such style functionality, enabling more flexible components that can be more quickly easily adapted to the needs of the content authors without any need for AEM back-end development.
