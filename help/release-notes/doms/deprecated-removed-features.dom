  <p>Adobe constantly evaluates product capabilities, to over time reinvent or replace older features with more modern alternatives to improve overall customer value, always under careful consideration of backward compatibility.</p> 
  <p>To communicate the impending removal/replacement of AEM capabilities, the following rules apply:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated, capabiiities are still available, but they will not be further enhanced. </li> 
   <li>Removal of deprecated capabilities will occur in the following major release at the earliest. Actual target date for removal will be announced. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>This process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal. </p> 
  <h2>Deprecated Features</h2>
  <p>This section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with AEM 6.4. Generally, features that are planned to be removed in a future release are set to deprecated first, with an alternative provided.</p> 
  <p>Customers are advised to review if they make use of the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.</p>
