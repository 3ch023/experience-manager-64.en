# Working with Dynamic Media{#working-with-dynamic-media}

[Dynamic Media](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management/dynamic-media.html) helps deliver rich visual merchandising and marketing assets on demand, automatically scaled for consumption on web, mobile, and social sites. Using a set of master assets, Dynamic Media generates and delivers multiple variations of rich content in real time through its global, scalable, performance-optimized network.

Dynamic media serves interactive viewing experiences, including zoom, 360-degree spin, and video. Dynamic media uniquely incorporates the workflows of the Adobe Experience Manager digital asset management (Assets) solution to simplify and streamline the digital campaign management process.

## Dynamic Media on versus Dynamic Media off {#dynamic-media-on-versus-dynamic-media-off}

You can tell whether Dynamic Media is turned on by the following characteristics:

* Dynamic Renditions are available when downloading or previewing assets.
* Image sets, Spin sets, Mixed media sets are available.
* PTIFF renditions are created.

When clicking on an image asset, the view of the asset is different with Dynamic Media [enabled](../../assets/using/config-dynamic.md#enabling-dynamic-media). Dynamic Media uses the on-demand HTML5 viewers.

### Dynamic Renditions {#dynamic-renditions}

Dynamic renditions such as image and viewer presets (under **Dynamic**) are available when Dynamic Media is enabled.
