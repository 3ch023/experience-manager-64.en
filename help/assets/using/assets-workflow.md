# Applying Workflows to Assets{#applying-workflows-to-assets}

Applying workflows to digital assets is the same as for website pages. For a complete guide on how to create and use workflows in AEM, see [Starting Workflows](../../sites/authoring/using/workflows-participating.md).

Use workflows in digital assets to activate the asset or create watermarks. Many of the workflows for assets are automatically turned on. For example, the workflow that automatically creates a rendition after an image is edited is automatically turned on.

The procedure to apply a workflow to multiple folders is similar to the procedure to apply a workflow to multiple assets. Select the folders in the Assets console, and perform steps 2-7 of the procedure [Applying a workflow to multiple assets](../../assets/using/assets-workflow.md#applying-a-workflow-to-multiple-assets).

## Applying a workflow to a collection {#applying-a-workflow-to-a-collection}
