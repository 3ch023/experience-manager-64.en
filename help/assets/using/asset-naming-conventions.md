# Naming conventions for assets{#naming-conventions-for-assets}

Nodes in the repository are subject to naming conventions of the [Java Content Repository](../../sites/developing/using/the-basics.md#javacontentrepository). However, Adobe Experience Manager imposes further conventions for the name of asset nodes.

### TOUCH-OPTIMIZED UI {#touch-optimized-ui}

The touch-optimized UI:

* Validates the name according to the restrictions:

    * an asset title is provided for conversion into the node name
    * an explicit node name is provided

AEM Assets does not let you specify "subassets" as the name of an asset folder. It is a keyword reserved for naming all CRXDe nodes that include subassets for compound assets.
