  <p>When uploading images, you can automatically crop the image upon upload by applying an Image Profile to the folder.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Smart Crop is available only in Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Crop Options</h3> 
  <p>You have two image cropping options to choose from and an option for automating the creation of color and image swatches.</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong>Option</strong></td> 
     <td><strong>When to use</strong></td> 
     <td><strong>Description</strong></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Pixel Crop</td> 
     <td>Bulk crop images based on dimensions only.</td> 
     <td><p>To use this option, select <strong>Pixel Crop</strong> from the Cropping Options drop-down list.</p> <p>To crop from the sides of an image, you enter the number of pixels to crop from any side or each side of the image. How much of the image is cropped depends on the ppi (pixels per inch) setting in the image file.</p> <p>An Image Profile pixel crop renders in the following manner:<br /> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Values are Top, Bottom, Left, and Right.</li> 
       <li>Top left is considered 0,0 and the pixel crop is calculated from there.</li> 
       <li>Crop starting point: Left is X and Top is Y</li> 
       <li>Horizontal calculation: horizontal pixel dimension of original image minus Left and then minus Right.</li> 
       <li>Vertical calculation: vertical pixel height minus Top, and then minus Bottom.</li> 
      </ul> <p>For example, suppose you have a 4000 x 3000 pixel image. You use values: Top=250; Bottom=500; Left=300; Right=700.</p> <p>From Top Left (300,250) crop using the fill space of (4000-300-700, 3000-250-500, or 3000,2250).</p> </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Smart Crop</td> 
     <td>Bulk crop images based on their visual focal point.</td> 
     <td><p>Smart Crop uses the power of artificial intelligence in Adobe Sensei to quickly automate the cropping of images in bulk. Smart Crop automatically detects and crops to the focal point in any image to capture the intended point of interest, regardless of screen size.</p> <p>To use Smart Crop, select <strong>Smart Crop</strong> from the Cropping Options drop-down list, then to the right of Responsive Image Crop, enable (turn on) the feature.</p> <p>The default breakpoint sizes of Large, Medium, and Small generally cover the full range of sizes that most images are used on mobile and tablet devices, desktops, and banners. If desired, you can edit the default names of Large, Medium, and Small.</p> <p>To add more breakpoints, click <strong>Add Crop</strong>; to delete a crop, click the Garbage Can icon.</p> </td>

     <td>Bulk generate an image swatch for each image.</td> 
     <td><p><strong>Note</strong>: Smart Swatch is not supported in Dynamic Media Classic.</p> <p>Automatically locate and generate high-quality swatches from product images that show color or texture.</p> <p>To use Color and Image Swatch, select <strong>Smart Crop</strong> from the Cropping Options drop-down list, then to the right of Color and Image Swatch, enable (turn on) the feature. Enter a pixel value in the Width and Height text boxes.</p> <p>While all image crops are available from the Renditions rail, swatches are only used by way of the Copy URL feature. Note that you must use your own viewing component to render the swatch on your site. (The exception to this is carousel banners. Dynamic Media provides the viewing component for the swatch used in carousel banners.)</p> <p><strong>Using image swatches</strong></p> <p>The URL for image swatches is straightforward. That is:</p> <p><span class="code">/is/image/company/&lt;asset_name&gt;:Swatch</span></p> <p>where <span class="code">:Swatch</span> is appended to the asset request.</p> <p><strong>Using color swatches</strong></p> <p>To use color swatches, you make a <span class="code">req=userdata</span> request with the following:</p> <p><span class="code">/is/image/&lt;company_name&gt;/&lt;swatch_asset_name&gt;:Swatch?req=userdata</span></p> <p>For example, the following is a swatch asset in Dynamic Media Classic (Scene7):</p> <p><span class="code">http://my.company.com:8080/is/image/DemoCo/Sleek:Swatch</span></p> <p>and here is the swatch asset's corresponding <span class="code">req=userdata</span> URL:</p> <p><span class="code">http://my.company.com:8080/is/image/DemoCo/Sleek:Swatch?req=userdata</span></p> <p>The <span class="code">req=userdata</span> response is as follows:</p> <p><code class="code">SmartCropDef=Swatch
        <discoiqbr /> SmartCropHeight=200.0

  <h3>Unsharp Mask</h3> 
  <p>You use<strong> Unsharp mask</strong> to fine-tune a sharpening filter effect on the final downsampled image. You can control intensity of effect, radius of the effect (measured in pixels), and a threshold of contrast that will be ignored. This effect uses the same options as Adobe Photoshop’s “Unsharp Mask” filter.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Unsharp mask is only applied to downscaled renditions within the PTIFF (pyramid tiff) that are downsampled more than 50%. That means that the largest-sized renditions within the ptiff are not affected by unsharp mask whereas smaller-sized renditions such as thumbnails are altered (and will show the unsharp mask). </p> 
  </note> 
  <p>In <strong>Unsharp Mask</strong>, you have the following filtering options:</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong>Option</strong></td> 
     <td><strong>Description</strong></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Amount</td> 
     <td>Controls the amount of contrast applied to edge pixels. The default is 1.75. For high-resolution images, you can increase it to as high as 5. Think of Amount as a measure of filter intensity. Range is 0-5.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Radius</td> 
     <td>Determines the number of pixels surrounding the edge pixels that affect the sharpening. For high-resolution images, enter from 1 through 2. A low value sharpens only the edge pixels; a high value sharpens a wider band of pixels. The correct value depends on the size of the image. The default value is 0.2. Range is 0-250.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Threshold</td> 
     <td><p>Determines the range of contrast to ignore when the unsharp mask filter is applied. In other words, this option determines how different the sharpened pixels must be from the surrounding area before they are considered edge pixels and are sharpened. To avoid introducing noise, experiment with values between 0-255.</p> </td>

  <h2>Creating image profiles</h2> 
  <p>To define advanced processing parameters for other asset types, see <a href="../../assets/using/config-dms7.md#configuringassetprocessing">Configuring Asset Processing</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>To create image profiles</strong>:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap or click <strong>Create</strong> to add a new image profile.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Enter a profile name, and values for unsharp mask, crop, or swatch, or both.</p> <p>You may find it helpful to use a profile name that is specific to its intended purpose. For example, if you want to create a profile that generates swatches only--that is, Smart Crop is disable (turned off) and Color and Image Swatch is enabled (turned on)--you could use the profile name "Smart Swatches".</p> <p>See also <a href="#smart-crop-and-smart-swatch-options">Smart Crop and Smart Swatch Options</a> and <a href="#unsharp-mask">Unsharp Mask</a>.</p>  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/crop.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The newly created profile appears in the list of available profiles.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Editing or deleting image profiles</h2> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select the image profile you want to edit or remove. To edit it, select <strong>Edit Image Processing Profile</strong>. To remove it, select <strong>Delete Image Processing Profile</strong>.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-255.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>If editing, save the changes. If deleting, confirm that you want to remove the profile.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Applying an image profile to folders</h2> 
  <p>When you assign an image profile to a folder, any subfolders automatically inherit the profile from its parent folder. This means that you can assign only one image profile to a folder. As such, consider carefully the folder structure of where you upload, store, use, and archive assets.</p> 
  <p>If you assigned a different image profile to a folder, the new profile overrides the previous profile. The previously existing folder assets remain unchanged. The new profile is applied on the assets that are added to the folder later. </p> 
  <p>Folders that have a profile assigned to it are indicated in the user interface by the name of the profile appearing in the card.</p> 
  <p>When you add smart crop to an existing image profile, you need to re-trigger the <a href="../../assets/using/assets-workflow.md" target="_blank">DAM Update Asset workflow</a> if you want to generate crops for existing assets in your asset repository.</p>  
  <p>You can apply image profiles to specific folders or globally to all assets. </p> 
  <h3>Applying image profiles to specific folders</h3> 
  <p>You can apply an image profile to a folder from within the <strong>Tools</strong> menu or if you are in the folder, from <strong>Properties</strong>. This section describes how to apply image profiles to folders both ways.</p> 
  <p>Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p> 
  <h4>Applying image profiles to folders from Profiles user interface</h4> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select the image profile that you want to apply to a folder or multiple folders.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-256.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Tap/click <strong>Apply Processing Profile to Folder(s) </strong>and select the folder or multiple folders you want use to receive the newly uploaded assets and tap/click <strong>Apply</strong>. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Applying image profiles to folders from Properties</h4> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Assets </strong>and then to the folder that you want to apply an image profile to.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>On the folder, tap or click the check mark to select it and then tap or click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap the <strong>Image Profiles</strong> tab. From the Profile Name drop-down list, select the profile, then click <strong>Save &amp; Close</strong>. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-257.png" /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Applying an image profile globally</h3> 
  <p>In addition to applying a profile to a folder, you can also apply one globally so that any content uploaded into AEM assets in any folder has the selected profile applied.</p> 
  <p>To apply a profile globally, do one of the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Navigate to <strong>http://&amp;lt;AEM server&amp;gt;/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/assets/foldersharewizard.html/content/dam</strong> and apply the appropriate profile and tap or click <strong>Save</strong>.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-258.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Navigate to CRXDE Lite to the following node: <strong>/content/dam/jcr:content.</strong></p> <p>Add the property<strong> imageProfile:/conf/global/settings/dam/adminui-extension/imageprofile/&amp;lt;name of image profile&amp;gt; </strong>and tap <strong>Save All</strong>. </p>  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/configure_image_profiles.png" /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Editing the smart crop or smart swatch of a single image</h2>  
  <note> 
   <p>Smart Crop is only available in Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p>You can manually realign or resize the smart crop window of an image to further refine its focal point.</p> 
  <p>After you edit a smart crop and save, the change is propagated everywhere you use the crop for the specific images.</p> 
  <p>You can re-run smart crop to generate the additional crops again, if required.</p>
