  <p>While the default configuration settings are appropriate for typical use cases, some situations may require you to make changes. </p> 
  <p>The following advanced configuration settings apply to the integration of AEM 3D for both Maya and non-Maya deployments.</p> 
  <p>All settings are accessed using CRXDE Lite in AEM (<strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>General </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>CRXDE Lite</strong>).</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>If you re-install the package, it resets all settings to their default values.</p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p>Editing any settings that are not listed in the table below may result in unexpected or undesired program behavior.</p> 
  </note>
