  <p>Organizations can integrate their Adobe Stock enterprise plan with AEM Assets to ensure that licensed assets are broadly available for their creative and marketing projects, with the powerful asset management capabilities of AEM.</p> 
  <p>Adobe Stock service provides designers and businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, and 3D assets for all their creative projects. AEM users are able to quickly find, preview, and license Adobe Stock assets that are saved in AEM, without leaving the AEM workspace.</p>

  <h2>Known limitations</h2> 
  <details> 
   <summary>Editorial image warning is not displayed</summary>

  </details> 
  <details> 
   <summary>Wrong license type is displayed</summary> 
   <p>It is possible that an incorrect license type is displayed in AEM for an asset. Users can log into the Adobe Stock website to see the license type.</p> 
  </details> 
  <details> 
   <summary>Reference fields and metadata are not synced</summary> 
   <p>When a user updates a license reference field, the license reference information is updated in AEM but not on the Adobe Stock website. Similarly, if the user updates the reference fields on the Adobe Stock website, the updates are not synchronized in AEM.</p>
