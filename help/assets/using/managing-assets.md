# Managing Assets{#managing-assets}

Managing assets - both images, video, and interactive assets - after they are uploaded involves many tasks including previewing, downloading, or publishing them.

When previewing, you can also apply image presets (for images only) or viewer presets (for video and images). You cannot apply both to an asset. See [Applying viewer presets](../../assets/using/viewer-presets.md) and [Applying image presets](../../assets/using/image-presets.md).

General information on managing assets can be found in [Managing Assets with the Touch UI](../../assets/using/managing-assets-touch-ui.md).

The following topics describe what you need to do to manage dynamic media assets:

* [Best practices for optimizing the quality of your images](../../assets/using/best-practices-for-optimizing-the-quality-of-your-images.md)
* [Previewing Assets](../../assets/using/previewing-assets.md)
* [Publishing Dynamic Media Assets](../../assets/using/publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md)
* [Working with Selectors](../../assets/using/working-with-selectors.md)
