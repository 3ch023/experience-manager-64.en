# Associated Content{#associated-content}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Some Content Fragment functionality requires the application of [AEM 6.4 Service Pack 2 (6.4.2.0) or later](../../release-notes/sp-release-notes.md).

Associated content provides the connection so that assets (i.e.) can be (optionally) used with the fragment when it is added to a content page. This provides flexibility by [providing a range of assets to access when using the content fragment on a page](../../sites/authoring/using/content-fragments.md#usingassociatedcontent), while also helping to reduce the time required to search for the appropriate asset.

### Adding Associated Content {#adding-associated-content}

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are various methods of adding [visual assets (e.g. images)](../../assets/using/content-fragments.md#fragmentswithvisualassets) to the fragment and/or page.

To make the association you first need to [add your media asset(s) to a collection](../../assets/using/managing-collections-touch-ui.md#addingassetstoacollection). Once that is done you can:

1. Open your fragment and select **Associated Content** from the side panel.

1. Select **Associate Content** or **Associate Collection** (as appropriate, depending on whether any collections have already been associated or not).
1. Select the required collection.

   You can optionally add the fragment itself to the selected collection; this aids tracking.

1. Confirm (with the check mark). The collection will be listed as associated.

### Editing Associated Content {#editing-associated-content}

Once you have associated a collection you can:

* **Remove** the association.
* **Add Assets** to the collection.
* Select an asset for further action.
* Edit the asset.
