# Getting Started with AEM Mobile{#getting-started-with-aem-mobile}

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](../../sites/developing/using/spa-overview.md).

>Existing AEM Mobile Apps customers migrating from AEM 6.2 or 6.3 to AEM 6.4 can continue to use AEM Mobile Apps by downloading a [package from PackageShare](https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq640/compatpack/aem-mobile-package). However, new installs of AEM 6.4 will not support AEM Mobile Apps functionality.

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Mobile is part of the Adobe Experience Manager multi-channel digital platform that also leverages AEM Assets, Sites, Screens, Workflow, User Manager, Commerce and Forms. AEM Mobile offers remarkable deployment flexibility, enabling enterprises to use a variety of content sources.

AEM Mobile offers multiple methods for creating apps. The three different ways that you can create apps are:

* ** [Using On-Demand Services with AEM](../../mobile/using/getting-started-aem-mobile-on-demand.md)**
* ** [Using On-Demand Services without AEM](https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-publishing-solution/topics.html)**
* ** [Using Adobe PhoneGap Enterprise with AEM](../../mobile/using/getting-started-aem-mobile-phonegap.md)**
