### Building AEM components that access device features {#building-aem-components-that-access-device-features}

The [AEM PhoneGap Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink) Github repository provides developers with a functional AEM app that illustrates the use of a number of core Cordova APIs. When run on iOS or Android via the PhoneGap CLI, the app opens up into the following page which includes a link to each device API that it demonstrates:

The source code for each of these device API components is [available on Github](https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink/tree/master/content/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/brucelefebvre/kitchen-sink/components).

For more detail on the usage of each API, I recommend taking a look at the [Cordova plugin documentation](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/4.0.0/cordova_plugins_pluginapis.md.html).
