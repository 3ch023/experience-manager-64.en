# Managing Content{#managing-content}

Content Management actions are the building blocks that help to create and manage content within an application. The following actions are performed on content within the application.

## Content Overview {#content-overview}

If you think of an online magazine, the main content includes articles, ads, and the covers. Three main types of Mobile On-Demand content can be created within AEM:

* **Articles**: text based along with art to convey information
* **Banners:** typically graphical promotional links
* **Collections:** represent a well defined *bucket* filled with content such as articles or banners that suits the cover's theme

* **Shared Resources:** allows reuse or sharing of common pieces across articles
