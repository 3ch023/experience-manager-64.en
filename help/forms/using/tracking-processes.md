# Tracking processes{#tracking-processes}

The process details show the tasks, assignments, and forms that were part of the process. You can also start new processes using form data from a process that you previously initiated.

## Search for processes and tasks {#search-for-processes-and-tasks}

You can search for process instances and associated tasks based on process names or by using search templates set by the AEM Forms workspace administrator.

You can set which columns appear in the search results.

>[!NOTE]
