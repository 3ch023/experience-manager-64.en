  <h2 id="audit_workflow_service_settings">Audit Workflow service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Workbench provides the ability to record process instances as they execute at runtime and then play them back to observe the behavior of the process. (See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_workbench_63">Workbench Help</a>.) To conserve space on the forms server's file system, you can limit the amount of process recording data that is stored. You can configure the following properties of the Audit Workflow Service service (<span class="code">AuditWorkflowService</span>):</p> 
  <p><strong>maxNumberOfRecordingInstances:</strong> The maximum number of recordings that are stored. When the maximum number is stored, the oldest recording is removed from the file system when a new recording is created. This property is useful if you tend to create many recordings and you want to remove old recordings automatically. The default value is 50.</p> 
  <p><strong>MaxNumberOfRecordingEntries:</strong> The maximum number of data entries that can be stored for each recording. Data entries are information about operations in the process. Several entries are stored for each execution of an operation, such as whether the operation started, whether the operation completed, and whether the route that leads to the operation is complete. This property is useful when processes can include many operation executions, for example, when an endless loop is encountered. The default value is 50.</p> 
  <h2 id="barcoded_forms_service_settings">barcoded forms service settings</h2>

  <h2 id="email_service_settings">Email service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Email is commonly used to distribute content or provide status information as part of an automated process. The Email service (<span class="code">EmailService</span>) enables processes to receive email messages from a POP3 or IMAP server, and send email messages to an SMTP server.</p> 
  <p>For example, a process uses the Email service to send an email message with a PDF form attachment. The Email service connects to an SMTP server to send the email message with the attachment. The PDF form is designed to let the recipient click Submit after completing the form. The action causes the form to be returned as an attachment to the designated email server. The Email service retrieves the returned email message and stores the completed form in a process data form variable.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the Email service. </p> 
  <p><strong>SMTP Host:</strong> The IP address or URL of the SMTP server to use for sending email.</p> 
  <p><strong>SMTP Port Number:</strong> The port used to connect to the SMTP server.</p>

  <h2 id="ftp_service_settings">FTP service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The FTP service (<span class="code">FTP</span>) enables processes to interact with an FTP server. FTP service operations can retrieve files from the FTP server, put files on the FTP server, and delete files from the FTP server. For example, documents such as reports generated from a process may be stored on an FTP server for distribution. Or an external system may generate some files based on previous steps in a process. In a subsequent step in the process, the files may be transferred to a remote location.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the FTP service. </p> 
  <p><strong>Default host:</strong> The IP address or URL of the FTP server.</p> 
  <p><strong>Default port:</strong> The port used to connect to the FTP server. The default value is 21.</p> 
  <p><strong>Default username:</strong> The name of the user account that you can use to access the FTP server. The user account must have sufficient privileges to perform the FTP operations that this service requires.</p> 
  <p><strong>Default password:</strong> The password to use with the specified user name for authenticating with the FTP server.</p> 
  <h2 id="generate_pdf_service_settings">Generate PDF service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Generate PDF service (<span class="code">GeneratePDFService</span>) converts files in various native formats to PDF documents, and converts PDF documents to a number of file formats.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the Generate PDF service.</p> 
  <p><strong>Adobe PDF Settings:</strong> The name of the pre-configured Adobe PDF settings to apply to a conversion job, if these settings are not specified as a part of the API invocation parameters. The Adobe PDF settings are configured in administration console, by clicking Services &gt; PDF Generator&gt; Adobe PDF Settings. These settings are applicable only to the PDFMaker based conversions.</p> 
  <p><strong>Security Settings:</strong> The name of the pre-configured security settings to apply to a conversion job, if these settings are not specified as a part of the API invocation parameters. The security settings are configured in administration console, by clicking Services &gt; PDF Generator&gt; Security Settings.</p> 
  <p><strong>File type Settings:</strong> The name of the pre-configured File Type Setting to apply to a conversion job, if these settings are not specified as a part of the API invocation parameters. The file type settings are configured in administration console, by clicking Services &gt; PDF Generator&gt; File Type Settings.</p> 
  <p><strong>Use Acrobat WebCapture (Windows Only):</strong> When this setting is true, the Generate PDF service uses Acrobat X Pro for all HTML to PDF conversions. This can improve the quality of the PDF files produced from HTML, though performance may be slightly lower. The default value is false.</p> 
  <p><strong>Use Acrobat Image Conversion (Windows Only):</strong> When this setting is true, the Generate PDF service uses Acrobat X Pro for all Image to PDF conversions. This setting is useful only if the default pure Java conversion mechanism is unable to convert a significant proportion of the input images successfully. The default value is false.</p> 
  <p><strong>Enable Acrobat-based AutoCAD Conversions (Windows Only):</strong> When this setting is true, the Generate PDF service uses Acrobat X Pro for all DWG to PDF conversions. This setting is useful only if AutoCAD is not installed on the server or the AutoCAD conversion mechanism is unable to convert files successfully.</p> 
  <p><strong>Regular Expressions For Finding Out Prohibited Special&amp;#xA;Characters In User Name (Windows Only):</strong> Specifies characters that interfere with the Export PDF and Optimize PDF operations when the characters appear in a user’s name.</p> 
  <p><strong>ImageToPDF Pool Size:</strong> The pool size of the default (pure Java) Image-to-PDF converter in the Generate PDF service. This setting controls the maximum simultaneous Image-to-PDF conversions that the Generate PDF service can perform. The default value of this setting (recommended for single-processor systems) is 3, which you can increase on multi-processor systems.</p> 
  <p><strong>HTML to PDF Pool Size:</strong> The pool size of the HTML-to-PDF converter in the Generate PDF service. This setting controls the maximum simultaneous HTML-to-PDF conversions that the Generate PDF service can perform. The default value of this setting (recommended for single-processor systems) is 3, which you can increase on multi-processor systems.</p> 
  <p><strong>OCR Pool Size:</strong> The pool size of the PaperCaptureService that PDF Generator uses for OCR. The default value of this setting (recommended for single-processor systems) is 3, which you can increase on multi-processor systems. This setting is valid only on Windows systems.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fallback Font Family For HTML To PDF Conversions:</strong> The name of the font family to use in PDF documents when the font used in the original HTML is not available to the AEM forms server. Specify a font family if you expect to convert HTML pages that use unavailable fonts. For example, pages authored in regional languages could use unavailable fonts.</p> 
  <p><strong>Retry Logic for Native Conversions</strong> Governs PDF generation retries if the first attempt at conversion has failed:</p> 
  <p><strong>No retry</strong> </p> 
  <p>Do not retry the PDF conversion if the first conversion attempt has failed</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>Retry</strong> </p> 
  <p>Retry PDF conversion regardless of whether the timeout threshold has been reached. The default timeout duration for the first attempt is 270s.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>Retry if time permits</strong> </p> 
  <p>Retry PDF conversion if the time consumed for the first conversion attempt was less than the specified timeout duration. For example, if the timeout duration is 270s and the first attempt consumed 200s, PDF Generator will reattempt the conversion. If the first attempt itself consumed 270s, conversion will not be retried.</p>

  <h2 id="guides_es4_utilities_service_settings">Guides ES4 Utilities service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>When you create a Guide, some resources, such as the Guide definition, are embedded in the Guide. Resources can also exist as references to application assets stored locally or on the AEM forms server. The Guide does not contain data, and the values for the submit location and inputs are not suitable for all external environments.</p> 
  <p>In most cases, the default Guides render services is sufficient to prepare a Guide for use in Workspace or other external environments. (In the Services view, in Workbench, the default service is Guides (system)/Processes/Render Guide - 1.0.) The Guide Utilities service (<span class="code">GuidesUtility</span>) allows you to create a customized process for rendering a Guide, if necessary. </p> 
  <p>The Guide Utilities operations allow you to add the following Guide rendering tasks to a process:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Determine whether data is available to populate the Guide with </p></li> 
   <li><p>Embed the Guide data or convert it to a link </p></li> 
   <li><p>Convert referenced content to URLs that are externally accessible </p></li> 
   <li><p>Substitute values in an HTML document or other wrapper, or convert them to URLs that are externally accessible </p></li> 
   <li><p>Set the submit location </p></li> 
   <li><p>Specify input values </p></li> 
   <li><p>Create a parameter to represent referenced content </p></li> 
   <li><p>If variations are available, set a variation </p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The default values for the Guide Utilities service support most use cases. However, if necessary, you can change the following values. </p> 
  <p><strong>publicPaths:</strong> This option has been deprecated. Do not use this option with AEM forms.</p> 
  <p><strong>pathInfoExpiryInSeconds:</strong> The interval after which a request for path information from a client expires. Default is 1.</p> 
  <p><strong>collateralExpiryInSeconds:</strong> The interval after which a request for collateral from a client expires. Default is 315576000.</p> 
  <p><strong>mismatchExpiryInSeconds:</strong> The interval after which a request for collateral from a client expires, when the eTag (entity tag) does not match. (An eTag is an HTTP response header.) Default is 1.</p> 
  <p><strong>guideContext:</strong> The context root of the Guides web application. Matches the value set using the Guides web application. Default is /Guides/.</p> 
  <p><strong>secureRandomAlgorithm:</strong> The algorithm to use when generating keys and identifiers. This value is passed to the getInstance method of the SecureRandom Java class. Default is SHA1PRNG.</p> 
  <p><strong>idBytes:</strong> The number of random bytes to use for a key identifier. Default is 6.</p> 
  <p><strong>macAlgorithm:</strong> The MAC (message authentication code) algorithm to use for collateral URL verification. This method is passed to the getInstance method of the Mac class. Default is HmacSHA1.</p> 
  <p><strong>macRefreshIntervalInMinutes:</strong> The amount of time a key is active. When a key has been active for this interval, a new key is generated. The new key becomes the active key. The previously active key is kept for 10% of the refresh interval. This behavior allows URLs that are generated by using the old key to continue to work across the key switch. Default is 144000.</p> 
  <p><strong>macOverlapIntervalInMinutes:</strong> Length of time that the previous key will remain valid after a new one is generated. The default is 1440 minutes (1 day).</p> 
  <p><strong>macKeySeed:</strong> A seed value for generating the secure URL. When this is option, the key is never refreshed. Setting the same seed on different servers will result in those servers generating secure URLs that are compatible. This may be useful if multiple forms servers are in use behind a load balancer. Enter a random sequence of characters and numbers as the seed.</p> 
  <h3 id="using_guides_in_a_server_cluster">Using Guides in a server cluster</h3> 
  <p></p>  
  <p>Rendering a Guide in a server cluster that does not use sticky sessions fails with a NullPointerException. A Guides request leverages secure URLs that, by default, are unique to the server they are generated on. In a cluster that uses sticky sessions, after a request hits a node in the cluster, all subsequent requests for that session or user are routed exclusively to that server, and everything is ok. In a cluster that does not use sticky sessions, subsequent requests can hit any server in the cluster. If the server that the requests hit is not the original server, they fail to resolve the secure URL. </p> 
  <p>If you are using Guides in a server cluster that does not use sticky sessions, set the macKeySeed value for the GuidesUtility service, and then stop and start the cluster. </p> 
  <p>The macKeySeed value is the seed for the random number generator that is used to generate the secure URLs. Setting this value causes each cluster node to initialize the random number generator in the same manner, and to have access to the same secure URLs. You can use any random string for this seed value. </p> 
  <p>Change the macKeySeed value when you need to refresh the secure URLs. Refreshing the secure URLs depends on your security policy, and is similar to the refresh policy for changing the master root password of the server. The macSeedValue is analogous to the master password for the secure URLs, because it is used to generate a new unique random number for use in secure URL generation and retrieval.</p> 
  <p>You must restart the cluster because the macSeedValue is read only at system startup. All nodes need to restart to read the value, because they use it independently to initialize their internal random numbers with the seed value.</p> 
  <h2 id="jdbc_service_settings">JDBC service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The JDBC service (<span class="code">JdbcService</span>) enables processes to interact with databases.</p>

  <p><strong>JNDI Username:</strong> The user name of the account to use for authenticating with the JNDI service provider that is used for looking up queue and topic names. The default value is guest.</p> 
  <p><strong>JNDI Password:</strong> The password that is associated with the user name specified for JNDI Username. The default value is guest.</p> 
  <p><strong>Initial Context Factory:</strong> The Java class to use as the initial context factory. The JMS service uses this class to create an initial context, which is the starting point for resolving names of topics and queues. The default value is the initial context factory for the JMS service on JBoss. The following classes are the initial context factories for the application servers that AEM forms supports:</p> 
  <p><strong>JBoss:</strong> org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory</p> 
  <p><strong>WebLogic:</strong> weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory</p> 
  <p><strong>WebSphere:</strong> com.ibm.websphere.naming.WsnInitialContextFactory</p> 
  <p><strong>Connection Username:</strong> The password that is associated with the user name specified for Connection Username. The default value is guest.</p> 
  <p><strong>Connection Password:</strong> The password that is associated with the user name specified for Connection Username. The default value is guest.</p> 
  <p><strong>Other Properties:</strong> Property name and value pairs that you can pass to the JNDI service provider. These properties depend on the implementation and configuration of the provider that you are using.</p> 
  <p>The property name and value pairs are separated by semi-colons (;). For example, the following text shows the value that would be specified for two properties named name1 and name2, with values value1 and value2, respectively:</p> 
  <p><span class="code">name1=value1;name2=value2</span></p> 
  <h2 id="ldap_service_settings">LDAP service settings</h2>

  <p>The following settings are available for the Remoting service.</p> 
  <p><strong>Flex Client Authentication Method:</strong> Determines the type of response that the server sends back to the client when the invoked service is security enabled, the operation invoked does not support anonymous invocations, and the client passes in either no or invalid credentials. Choose from Custom or Basic. The default value is Basic.</p> 
  <p><strong>Allow Serialization Of Non-Serializable Classes:</strong> Most AEM forms endpoints allow only Serializable classes to be used for invocation. In older versions, the Remoting endpoint allowed non-Serializable classes to be used for invocation from Flex-based clients. To prevent a security vulnerability described in APS11-15, this was changed. If you want to continue to use non-Serializable classes with the Flex Remoting endpoint, select this checkbox.</p> 
  <h2 id="repository_service_settings">Repository service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Repository service (<span class="code">RepositoryService</span>) provides resource storage and management services to AEM forms. When developers create an application, they can deploy the assets in the repository instead of on a file system. The assets can include any type of collateral, including XML forms, PDF forms (including Acrobat forms), form fragments, images, profiles, policies, SWF files, DDX files, XML schemas, WSDL files, and test data.</p>

  <p><strong>Provider Service:</strong> The name of the service that is used as the storage provider. The default value is RepositoryProviderService.</p> 
  <h2 id="signature_service_settings">Signature service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Signature service (<span class="code">SignatureService</span>) enables your organization to protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that documents are not altered. Altering a document breaks its signature. Because security features are applied to the document itself, the document remains secure and controlled for its entire life cycle; beyond the firewall, when it is downloaded offline, and when it is submitted back to your organization.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the Signature service.</p> 
  <p><strong>Name Of The Remote HSM SPI Service:</strong> This option is for use when the HSM is installed on a remote computer. Specify this option when AEM forms is installed on a 64-bit Windows and you are using HSM devices for signing.</p> 
  <p><strong>URL Of The Remote HSM Web Service:</strong> Specify this option when AEM forms is installed on 64-bit Windows and you are using HSM devices for signing.</p>

  <h2 id="watched_folder_service_settings">Watched Folder service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Watched Folder service (<span class="code">WatchedFolder</span>) configures attributes that are common for all watched folder endpoints. It also provides default values for watched folder endpoints. (See <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/configuring-watched-folder-endpoints.md#configuring-watched-folder-endpoints">Configuring watched folder endpoints</a>.) It is not invoked by external client applications or used in processes created in Workbench.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the Watched Folder service. </p> 
  <p><strong>Cron Expression:</strong> The cron expression as used by quartz to schedule the polling of the input directory.</p> 
  <p><strong>Repeat Count:</strong> The number of times the input directory is polled. The default repeat count to use if this value is not specified in the endpoint configuration. A value of -1 indicates indefinite scanning of the directory. The default value is -1.</p> 
  <p><strong>Repeat Interval:</strong> The default number if seconds between each poll. This value is used as the repeat interval unless a different value is specified in the watched folder endpoint configuration. The default value is 5. See the description of the Batch Size setting for additional information.</p> 
  <p><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> Identifies the invocation type as asynchronous or synchronous. Transient and synchronous processes can only be invoked synchronously. The default value is asynchronous.</p> 
  <p><strong>Wait Time:</strong> The default value for time, in seconds, after which the files are retrieved from the input folders. If the file or folder is older than the time specified in the wait time, it is picked up for processing. The default value is 0.</p> 
  <p><strong>Batch Size:</strong> The default value for the number of files or folder that are processed per scan. The default value is 2.</p> 
  <p>The Repeat Interval and Batch Size settings determine how many files Watched Folder picks up in every scan. Watched Folder uses a Quartz thread pool to scan the input folder. The thread pool is shared with other services. If the scan interval is small, the threads scan the input folder often. If files are dropped frequently into the watched folder, keep the scan interval small. If files are dropped infrequently, use a larger scan interval so that the other services can use the threads.</p> 
  <p>If there is a large volume of files being dropped, make the batch size large. For example, if the service invoked by the watched folder endpoint can process 700 files per minute, and users drop files into the input folder at the same rate, then setting the Batch Size to 350 and the Repeat Interval to 30 seconds will help Watched Folder performance without incurring the cost of scanning the watched folder too often.</p> 
  <p>When files are dropped into the watched folder, it lists the files in the input, which can reduce performance if scanning is happening every second. Increasing the scan interval can improve performance. If the volume of files being dropped is small, adjust the Batch Size and Repeat Interval accordingly. For example, if 10 files are dropped every second, try setting the Repeat Interval to 1 second and the Batch Size to 10.</p> 
  <p>In a cluster configuration, the batch size for a watched folder endpoint does not scale to multiple cluster nodes. For example, if the batch size is set to <span class="code">2</span> for a two-node cluster and the Throttle option is selected, the nodes process files collectively in batches of two instead of each node processing two files at a time.</p> 
  <p><strong>Overwrite Duplicate Filenames:</strong> A Boolean string that specifies whether the watched folder overwrites duplicate result filenames and whether preserved documents of the same name should be overwritten.</p> 
  <p><strong>Preserve Folder:</strong> The default value for the preserve folder. This folder is used to copy the source files into in case of successful processing of the input. This value can be an empty, relative, or absolute path with a file pattern as described for the Result Folder setting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Failure Folder:</strong> The name of the folder where the failure files are copied. This value can be an empty, relative, or absolute path with a file pattern as described for the Result Folder setting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Result Folder:</strong> The default name for the result folder. This folder is used to copy the results files into. This value can be an empty, relative, or absolute path with the following file pattern.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>%F = filename prefix </p></li> 
   <li><p>%E = filename extension</p></li> 
   <li><p>%Y = year (full) </p></li> 
   <li><p>%y = year (last two digits) </p></li> 
   <li><p>%M = month</p></li> 
   <li><p>%D = day of month </p></li> 
   <li><p>%d = day of year </p></li> 
   <li><p>%H = hour (24-hour clock) </p></li> 
   <li><p>%h = hour (12-hour clock) </p></li> 
   <li><p>%m = minute </p></li> 
   <li><p>%s = second </p></li> 
   <li><p>%l = millisecond </p></li> 
   <li><p>%R = random number (from 0 through 9) </p></li> 
   <li><p>%P = process or job id</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For example, if it is 8 PM on July 17, 2009 and you specify <span class="code">C:/Test/WF0/failure/%Y/%M/%D/%H/</span>, the result folder is <span class="code">C:/Test/WF0/failure/2009/07/17/20</span>. </p> 
  <p>If the path is not absolute but relative, the folder is created inside the watched folder. For more information about file patterns, see <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/configuring-watched-folder-endpoints.md#about-file-patterns">About file patterns</a>. </p> 
  <p><i><strong>Note</strong>: The smaller the size of the result folders, the better Watched Folder performance will be. For example, if the estimated load for the watched folder is 1000 files every hour, try a pattern like <span class="code">result/%Y%M%D%H</span> so that a new subfolder is created every hour. If the load is smaller (for example, 1000 files per day), you could use a pattern like <span class="code">result/%Y%M%D</span>.</i></p> 
  <p><strong>Stage Folder:</strong> The default name for the stage folder inside the watched folder.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input Folder:</strong> The default name for the input folder inside the watched folder.</p> 
  <p><strong>Preserve On Failure:</strong> If true, original files are preserved in the failure folder on failure.</p> 
  <p><strong>Throttle:</strong> When this option is selected, it limits the number of watched folder jobs that AEM forms processes at any given time. The Batch Size value determines the maximum number of jobs (See About throttling).</p> 
  <h2 id="web_service_service_settings">Web Service service settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Web Service service (<span class="code">WebService</span>) enables processes to invoke web service operations.</p> 
  <p>The Web Service service enables processes to invoke web service operations. For example, an organization may want to integrate a process to store and retrieve information such as contact and account details by invoking a service provider’s exposed web services. The Web Service service invokes a specified web service and passes through values for each of its parameters. It then saves the return values from the operation into a designated variable within a process.</p> 
  <p>The Web Service service interacts with web services by sending and receiving SOAP messages. The service also supports sending MIME, MTOM, and SwaRef attachments with SOAP messages by using the WS-Attachment protocol. The Web Service service interactions are compatible with SAP systems and .NET web services.</p> 
  <p>The following settings are available for the Web Service service.</p>

  <h2 id="configuring_pooling_for_a_service">Configuring pooling for a service</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Each service can take advantage of the pooling capabilities to handle incoming invocation requests. Using a service pool ensures that service instances are invoked by a single thread at a time and are reused across invocation requests, which may result in improved performance. You can also use pooling to specify the Maximum Asynchronous Service Instances option, which allows services to limit the number of requests handled in parallel.</p>
