  <h2 id="image_to_pdf_settings">Image to PDF settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The following options determine how image files are converted to PDF. For instructions about accessing these settings, see <a href="configuring-file-type-settings#create_or_edit_file_type_settings">Create or edit file type settings</a>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Filename Extensions:</strong> Comma-separated list of filename extensions that can be converted.</p> 
  <p><strong>Try Fallback Converter:</strong> PDF Generator can use either Java™ or Acrobat to convert image files to PDF. When this option is selected and a conversion fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, PDF Generator attempts the conversion by using the alternate method. If alternate method fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, an exception is written to the log file.</p> 
  <p><i><strong>Note</strong>: JPEG 2000 files can only be converted using Acrobat.</i></p> 
  <p><strong>Use OCR:</strong> Specifies whether to apply OCR (optical character recognition) to the PDF. OCR software enables you to search, correct, and copy the text in the PDF.</p> 
  <p><i><strong>note</strong>: The OCR PDF (searchable PDF) feature is supported only on Microsoft Windows.</i></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>Primary OCR Language:</strong> Specifies the language for the OCR engine to use to identify the characters.</p> 
  <p><strong>PDF Output Style:</strong> Determines the type of PDF to produce. All formats apply OCR and font and page recognition to the text images and convert them to normal text.</p> 
  <p><strong>Searchable Image:</strong> Ensures that text is searchable and selectable. This option keeps the original image, deskews it as needed, and places an invisible text layer over it. The Downsample Images option determines whether the image is downsampled and to what extent.</p> 
  <p><strong>Searchable Image (Exact):</strong> Ensures that text is searchable and selectable. This option keeps the original image and places an invisible text layer over it. Recommended for cases that require maximum fidelity to the original image.</p> 
  <p><strong>ClearScan:</strong> Synthesizes a new Type 3 font that closely approximates the original, and preserves the page background by using a low-resolution copy.</p> 
  <p><strong>Downsample Images:</strong> Decreases the number of pixels in color, grayscale, and monochrome images after OCR is complete. Choose the degree of downsampling to apply. Higher-numbered options do less downsampling, which produces higher-resolution PDFs.</p> 
  <h2 id="adobe_pdf_export_settings_windows_only">Adobe PDF export settings (Windows only)</h2> 
  <p>The Export File Type setting in the Adobe PDF export settings section is used for converting a PDF file to another format. The default is HTML 4.01 with cascading style sheets (CSS) 1.0<strong></strong>(*.htm, *.html). </p> 
  <p>For instructions about accessing this setting, see <a href="configuring-file-type-settings#create_or_edit_file_type_settings">Create or edit file type settings</a>. </p> 
  <h2 id="html_to_pdf_settings">HTML-to-PDF settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The following options determine how HTML files are converted to PDF. For instructions about accessing these options, see <a href="configuring-file-type-settings#create_or_edit_file_type_settings">Create or edit file type settings</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Try Fallback Converter:</strong> PDF Generator can use either Java™ or Acrobat to convert HTML files to PDF. When this option is selected and a conversion fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, PDF Generator attempts the conversion by using the alternate method. If alternate method fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, an exception is written to the log file.</p> 
  <p><strong>Default Encoding:</strong> Sets the input encoding of the file text from a menu of operating systems and alphabets. Uses the selection shown in the Default Encoding option only if the HTML source file does not specify a type of encoding.</p> 
  <p><strong>Force Selected Encoding:</strong> Ignores any encoding that is specified in the HTML source file and uses the selection shown in the Default Encoding option.</p> 
  <h3 id="spidering_settings">Spidering settings</h3> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><i>Spidering</i> scans web pages for links to other web pages. When a link to another web page is encountered, the destination page is fetched and included in the PDF document that is generated. Enable these options to set the number of levels to be fetched and converted to PDF:</p> 
  <p><strong>Get Only X Levels:</strong> Spiders and converts pages up to a depth of the specified level from the base page URL. A value of 1 converts only the supplied URL.</p> 
  <p><strong>Get Entire Site:</strong> Converts the entire site, starting from the provided URL.</p> 
  <p><strong>Stay On Same Path:</strong> Any links that point to pages that are not on the same relative path as the base URL are not converted during spidering.</p> 
  <p><strong>Stay On Same Server:</strong> Any links that point to pages on different servers are not converted during spidering. Only links that point to the same server as the specified URL are converted.</p> 
  <h3 id="page_conversion_settings">Page conversion settings</h3> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Enable these options to specify how the HTML pages are converted. Based on the page size, the width, height, and margin values adjust accordingly. </p> 
  <p><strong>Page Size:</strong> Choose custom and specify the width and height, or select predefined dimensions.</p> 
  <p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Select either portrait or landscape for the converted PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Margins:</strong> Specifies the margins (Top, Bottom, Left, and Right) in the generated PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Add Bookmarks To PDF:</strong> Adds bookmarks to the PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Enable Tagged PDF:</strong> Embeds tags in the PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Set Initial View Settings:</strong> Lets you configure Document Options, Window Options, and User Interface Options. These settings determine how the content is initially displayed.</p>

  <h2 id="flash_videos_to_pdf_settings">Flash videos to PDF settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>PDF Generator supports the ability to submit a video for Adobe Flash (SWF or FLV file) and create a PDF file with a video for Adobe Flash embedded in it. This conversion does not require Adobe Flash Player to be installed on the forms server.

  <h2 id="pdf_optimizer_settings">PDF optimizer settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>PDF Generator supports the ability to reduce the size of PDF files. Whether you use all these settings or only a few depends on how you intend to use the files and on the essential properties that a file must have. In most cases, the default settings are appropriate for maximum efficiency - saving space by removing embedded fonts, compressing images, and removing items from the files that are no longer needed.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Optimizing a digitally signed document removes and invalidates the digital signatures. </p> 
  </note> 
  <p>For instructions about accessing this setting, see <a href="configuring-file-type-settings#create_or_edit_file_type_settings">Create or edit file type settings</a>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Target PDF Version:</strong> Specifies the version of Acrobat that the PDF is compatible with.</p> 
  <h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3> 
  <p></p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Select <strong>Fonts.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select one of the following options:</p> <p><strong>Unembed all fonts: </strong>Unembeds all embedded fonts.</p> <p><strong>Do not unembed any font: </strong>Does not unembed any fonts.</p> <p><strong>Unembed some fonts: </strong>Unembeds only the specified fonts. Follow these steps to specify the fonts that you want to unembed:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><p>If necessary, select a different fonts directory from the <strong>Font source</strong> drop-down menu. This drop-down menu lists fonts directories specified in <strong>Home &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Core System &amp;gt; Core Configurations</strong>.</p> </li> 
     <li><p>Select one or more fonts from the <strong>Available Fonts</strong> list and click <strong>Add</strong>. These fonts are added to the <strong>Fonts to Unembed</strong> list.</p> </li> 
     <li><p>If you want to unembed some fonts that don’t exist on the forms server, enter the names of those fonts in the <strong>Add fonts to unembed</strong> box. Click <strong>Add</strong>.</p> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <note> 
     <p><em>If you want to unembed some fonts whose subsets are embedded in the document, prefix the font name with the + sign. For example, “+Helvetica”.</em></p> 
    </note></li> 
   <li><p>If you want to embed only the in-use subsets of the embedded fonts, select <strong>Subset all embedded fonts</strong>.</p> 
    <note> 
     <p><em>If you’re using this option in combination with <strong>Unembed some fonts</strong>, fonts in the <strong>A<strong>dd fonts to unembed</strong></strong> list are still completely unembedded.</em></p> 
    </note> 
    <note> 
     <p><em>Font subsetting is the technique of embedding only a portion of a font. A font subset contains only the characters used in your document.</em></p> 
    </note></li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3> 
  <p>If your PDF document includes artwork that contains transparency, you can use the PDF Optimizer settings to flatten transparency and reduce file size.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>If Acrobat 4.0 and later is selected as the Target PDF version, all transparent objects are flattened. For other Target PDF versions, transparency is supported and you can configure the transparency settings.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p>Select <strong>Transparency</strong> to configure the transparency settings while optimizing PDF documents.</p> 
  <p><strong>Transparency level</strong> Specifies the amount of vector information that will be preserved. Higher settings preserve more vector objects, while lower settings rasterize more vector objects; intermediate settings preserve simple areas in vector form and rasterize complex ones. Select the lowest setting to rasterize all the artwork.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>The amount of rasterization that occurs depends on the complexity of the page and the types of overlapping objects.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p><strong>Line Art and Text</strong> Resolution to which all objects, including images, vector artwork, text, and gradients, are rasterized. The supported values are 1 pixels per inch (ppi) to 9600 ppi.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Line Art and Text resolution should generally be set to 600-1200 ppi to provide high-quality rasterization, especially on serif or small point sized type.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p><strong>Gradient and Meshes</strong> Resolution to which gradient and meshes are rasterized. The supported values are 1 ppi to 1200 ppi.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Gradient and mesh resolution should generally be set to 150-300 ppi because the quality of the gradients, drop shadows, and feathers do not improve with higher resolutions, but printing time and file size increase.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p><strong>Convert All Text to Outlines</strong> Converts all type objects (point type, area type, and path type) to outlines and discards all type glyph information on pages containing transparency. This option ensures that the width of text stays consistent during flattening. Note that enabling this option will cause small fonts to appear slightly thicker when viewed in Acrobat or printed on low-resolution desktop printers. It doesn’t affect the quality of the type printed on high-resolution printers or imagesetters.</p> 
  <p><strong>Convert All Strokes to Outlines</strong> Converts all strokes to simple filled paths on pages containing transparency. This option ensures that the width of strokes stays consistent during flattening. Note that enabling this option causes thin strokes to appear slightly thicker and may degrade flattening performance.</p> 
  <p><strong>Clip Complex Regions</strong> Ensures that the boundaries between vector artwork and rasterized artwork fall along object paths. This option reduces stitching artifacts that result when part of an og] "&gt;</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Some print drivers process raster and vector art differently, sometimes resulting in color stitching. You may be able to minimize stitching problems by disabling some print-driver specific color-management settings. These settings vary with each printer, so see the documentation that came with your printer for details.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p> Preserve Overprint: Blends the color of transparent artwork with the background color to create an overprint effect.</p> 
  <p>The following table shows common types of printers and their resolution measured in dpi, their default screen ruling measured in lines per inch (lpi), and a resampling resolution for images measured in pixels per inch (ppi). For example, if you were printing to a 600-dpi laser printer, you would enter 170 for the resolution at which to resample images.</p> 
  <p><strong>Images</strong> Select Images to specify compression and resampling options for color, grayscale, and monochrome images. You may want to experiment with these options to find an appropriate balance between file size and image quality.The resolution setting for color and grayscale images should be 1.5 to 2 times the line screen ruling at which the file will be printed. The resolution for monochrome images should be the same as the output device, but be aware that saving a monochrome image at a resolution higher than 1500 dpi increases the file size without noticeably improving image quality. Images that will be magnified, such as maps, may require higher resolutions.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Resampling monochrome images can have unexpected viewing results, such as no image display. If this happens, turn off resampling and convert the file again. This problem is most likely to occur with subsampling, and least likely with bicubic downsampling.</p>

  <h2>OpenOffice settings</h2> 
  <p>These options determine how OpenOffice files are converted. For instructions about accessing these options, see <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/configuring-file-type-settings1.md#create-or-edit-file-type-settings">Create or edit file type settings</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Try PDFMaker As Fallback Converter</strong>: When this option is selected and a conversion using OpenOffice fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, PDF Generator attempts the conversion by using PDFMaker. If the conversion using PDFMaker fails or reaches the specified time-out limit, an exception is written to the log file.</p> 
  <p><strong>Filename Extensions</strong>: Specify the filename extensions for file types, separated by commas, that are accepted for this application. The default is <span class="code">odt,odp,ods,odg,odf,sxw,sxi,sxd</span>. Do not include a period before or a space between the extensions.</p> 
  <p><strong>Range</strong>: Convert all pages or specify particular pages or a page range. If a page range is not defined, all pages are converted. To export a range of pages, use the format 3-6. To export single pages, use the format 7;9;11. You can export a combination of page ranges and single pages by using a format such as 3-6;8;10;12.</p> 
  <p><strong>Page Orientation</strong>: For plain text files only, select either portrait or landscape for the converted PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Images</strong>: Configure how images are converted. EPS images with embedded previews are exported only as previews. EPS images without embedded previews are exported as empty placeholders. With lossless compression of images, all pixels are preserved. With JPEG compression of images and a high-quality level, almost all pixels are preserved. With a low-quality level, some pixels get lost and artifacts are introduced, but file sizes are reduced.</p> 
  <p><strong>General</strong>: Enable the options to convert a tagged PDF or to export Writer and FormCalc document notes, Impress slide transition effects, or blank pages to the PDF. When tags are exported, the file size can increase by large amounts. Some tags that are exported are tables of contents, hyperlinks, and controls.</p> 
  <p>You can also specify how forms are submitted. The options are XML, FDF, PDF, or HTML. This setting overrides the control's URL property that you set in the document. Only one common setting can be selected for the PDF document:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>PDF (sends the whole document)</li> 
   <li>FDF (sends the control contents)</li> 
   <li>HTML</li> 
   <li>XML</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Tagged PDF</strong>: Enables creation of tagged PDF from OpenOffice documents. Tagged PDF contains information about the structure of the document contents. This can help when displaying the document on devices with different screens, and when using screen reader software. It also helps accessibility software to perform various useful operations with the PDF document, such as reading aloud the contents of the PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Export Notes</strong>: Converts the notes in OpenOffice documents to notes in the generated PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Use Transition Effects</strong>: Converts the slide transition effects in OpenOffice presentations to corresponding PDF transition effects.</p> 
  <p><strong>Submit Forms In Format</strong>: Creates a PDF form that can be filled out and printed by the user of the PDF document.</p> 
  <p><strong>Export Automatically Inserted Blank Pages</strong>: When this option is selected, automatically inserted blank pages are included in the generated PDF document. This is useful if you are printing a PDF document double-sided. For example, a book may be configured so that the first page of chapter always starts on an odd-numbered page. If the previous chapter ends on an odd-numbered page, OpenOffice insets a blank even-numbered page. This option controls whether to include that even-numbered page in the generated PDF.</p>
