# Considerations when running AdministrationConsole{#considerations-when-running-administrationconsole}

These are some things to consider when running Administration Console:

* If you access administration console using the URL http://*[hostname]*:*[port]*/adminui, the specified host name cannot contain underscore characters. Otherwise, links to some areas of the administration console may not work properly.
* If you run administration console in Windows Explorer on a Japanese OS, you may encouter these problems:

    * Clicking a link returns you to the login page instead of to the expected link.
    * Clicking a link displays a permission error.

  Best practice is run administration console from another browser, such as Mozilla Firefox, to ensure that no links will fail.

* Do not use backslash characters () when performing searches in administration console.
