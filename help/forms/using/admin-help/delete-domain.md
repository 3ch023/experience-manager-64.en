# Delete a domain {#delete-a-domain}

Use the Domain Management page to mark an existing domain as obsolete.

If you create a domain with the same name as a deleted domain, the deleted domain is reinstated along with the information that it contained. The DefaultDom domain cannot be deleted.

1. In administration console, click Settings &gt; User Management &gt; Domain Management.
1. Select the check box for the domain to delete, click Delete, and then click OK.
