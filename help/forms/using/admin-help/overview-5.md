# Introduction to working with PDF Generator{#introduction-to-working-with-pdf-generator}

PDF Generator converts various file formats to PDF. It also converts PDF to other file formats and optimizes the size of PDF documents. For a list of supported file formats, see “Generate PDF service” in [Services Reference](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_services_63).

**Sending files to PDF Generator for processing**

There are three ways to send files to PDF Generator for processing:

* Administrators can access the PDFG pages in Administration Console. (See [Converting files using PDF Generator](../../../forms/using/admin-help/converting-files-using-pdf-generator.md).)
* Users can access the PDFG end-user pages by logging in to http(s)://[server]:[port]/pdfgui. From there, they can access the PDFG Network Printer, Create PDF, HTML to PDF, Export PDF, and Optimize PDF pages.
* You can configure endpoints for the services. (See [Managing Endpoints](/forms/using/admin-help/topics/managing-endpoints) and [Generate PDF service recommendations](../../../forms/using/admin-help/configuring-watched-folder-endpoints.md#generate-pdf-service-recommendations).)
