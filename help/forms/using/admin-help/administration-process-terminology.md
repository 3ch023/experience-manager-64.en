# About administration and process terminology{#about-administration-and-process-terminology}

To administer forms workflow effectively, you should understand the following terms and the hierarchy of the elements:

* *Process categories* organize processes into logical groups.
* *Processes* represent the business processes that are automated. At least one process should exist for each business process implemented. 
* A *process diagram* is the visual representation of the business process that is being automated. 
* A *process instance* is a process that has been initiated by a user (such as completing and submitting a form) or an automated step. There may be multiple instances of a process.
* An *operation *is one step of a process diagram, which is represented in Workbench by an icon in the process diagram.
* A *task* is an action that has been assigned to a user. When the task is run and the operation is executed, the User service assigns a task to a user.

For more information about these terms, see [Workbench Help](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_workbench_63).
