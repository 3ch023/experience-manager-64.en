  <p>AEM 6.3 Forms includes several new features and enhancements that streamline the creation, management, and user experiences with forms, documents, and correspondences. It also brings enhancements to Adobe Sign and Forms Workflow and many new features such as Data Integration. To learn about all the new capabilities and enhancements of AEM 6.3 Forms, see <a href="../../../forms/using/whats-new.md">New features summary document</a>.</p> 
  <p>You can upgrade or migrate from existing LiveCycle or AEM Forms to AEM 6.3 Forms. You can perform a direct upgrade from AEM 6.1 Forms and AEM 6.2 Forms to AEM 6.3 Forms. You can also perform a multi-hop upgrade from various releases of LiveCycle and AEM 6.1 Forms. </p> 
  <p>You can upgrade your existing AEM Forms server to obtain new capabilities and enhancements offered in AEM 6.3 Forms while retaining existing data, processes, and assets intact. On upgrade, metadata and state of the processes is also preserved. You can choose an upgrade path to get started with upgrade:</p> 
  <h2>Choose between upgrade and migration</h2> 
  <p><strong>Upgrade</strong> refers to the process by which an existing AEM Forms server is moved from one version to a newer version. Upgrades are always fully supported and are tested in many configurations before being released. In an upgrade, data on the server is transformed at the database level, and all data, metadata, and state of the processes is preserved. Upgrading to an AEM Forms server involves downtime.</p> 
  <p><strong>Migration</strong> refers to the process of replaying actions from one system into another fresh installation of AEM Forms. One of the key differences as compared to an upgrade is that a migration involves moving only assets (PDF, XDP, images, adaptive forms, adaptive documents, correspondence management assets) from one server to another - processes (LCA), settings, configurations, and a few other pieces of metadata are not migrated. Migration can be performed with the minimum amount of downtime. Depending on the modules, processes, and assets used, migration can also require a lot of rework.</p> 
  <h4 id="MigrateWhen">Migrate when</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>You do not require existing workflows and processes. Migration does not move existing processes (LCAs) to AEM 6.3 Forms.<br /> </li> 
   <li>You are using AEM Forms on JEE only for document services (PDF Generator, Output, and more) or forms (adaptive forms, HTML5 forms, PDF Forms), then <a href="#main-pars-accordion-container-1460251140">Migrate to AEM 6.3 Forms on OSGi</a>.</li> 
   <li>You are using AEM Forms on JEE Process Management and the <a href="../../../forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md" target="_blank">Forms-centric AEM Workflows on OSGi</a> capability suits your requirement.<br /> </li> 
   <li>You are running short lived processes on AEM Forms on JEE. You have the following choices in the order of recommendation 
    <ul> 
     <li>Set up a fresh AEM 6.3 Forms on JEE environment and <a href="#main-pars-accordion-container-1460251140">migrate existing processes (LCAs) or other assets to the fresh environment</a>.<br /> </li> 
     <li>Install a fresh instance of AEM 6.3 Forms on OSGi, <a href="#main-pars-accordion-container-1460251140">move XDP, and other compatible assets to the new instance, and build services</a>, if necessary.<br /> </li> 
     <li>Set up a fresh AEM 6.3 Forms on JEE environment and <a href="#main-pars-accordion-container-1460251140" style="outline: 1px dotted; outline-offset: 0px;">migrate existing processes (LCA) or other assets to fresh environment</a>. Migrate to AEM Forms on OSGi at a later stage.<br /> </li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Upgrade when</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>You are looking to use latest features of AEM 6.3 Forms while keeping everything (processes and assets) available on the previous version intact.<br /> </li> 
   <li>You are running long lived processes on AEM Forms on JEE.</li>

After the package is uploaded, click package name, and click <strong>Install.</strong></p> 
      <note> 
       <p>After the package is installed, you are prompted to restart the AEM instance. <strong>Do not immediately stop the server.</strong> Before stopping the AEM Forms server, wait until the ServiceEvent REGISTERED and ServiceEvent UNREGISTERED messages stop appearing in the &amp;lt;crx-repository&amp;gt;/error.log file and the log is stable. Also note, the following three packages can remain in the installed state. You can safely ignore the state of these packages:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Adobe Correspondence Management Migration</li> 
        <li>Adobe LiveCycle FormsManager Core</li> 
        <li>Forms Common Service</li> 
       </ul> 
      </note></li> 
     <li><p>Stop the AEM instance and delete the following files:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>[AEM_Installation_Directory]\[crx-quickstart]\launchpad\ext\bcmail-jdk15-1.35</li> 
       <li>[AEM_Installation_Directory]\[crx-quickstart]\launchpad\ext\bcprov-jdk15-1.35</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><p>Start the AEM instance.</p> </li> 
    </ol></li> 
   <li><p>Perform post-installation activities.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>The migration utility makes the adaptive forms and correspondence management assets of earlier versions compatible with AEM 6.3 forms. You can download the utility from AEM package share. For step-by-step information to configure and use the migration utility, see <a href="../../../forms/using/migration-utility.md" target="_blank">migration utility</a> documentation.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>If you had Adobe Sign configured in the previous version of AEM Forms, then reconfigure Adobe Sign from AEM Cloud services. For more details, see <a href="../../../forms/using/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md" target="_blank">Integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, AEM 6.3 Forms release has introduced many new Adobe Sign features. For step-by-step information to use Adobe Sign, see <a href="../../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md" target="_blank">Using Adobe Sign in an adaptive form</a>.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>In AEM 6.3 Forms, traffic variable for source and success event for impression are not available. So, when you upgrade to AEM 6.3 Forms, AEM Forms stops sending data to Adobe Analytics server and analytics reports for adaptive forms and adaptive document are not available. Moreover, AEM 6.3 Forms introduces traffic variable for the version of form analytics and success event for the amount of time spent on a field. So, reconfigure analytics and reports for your AEM Forms environment. For detailed steps, see <a href="../../../forms/using/configure-analytics-forms-documents.md">Configuring analytics and reports</a>.</p> <p>Methods to calculate average fill time for forms and average read time for adaptive documents have changed. So, when you upgrade to AEM 6.3 forms, older data (data from previous AEM Forms release) for these metrics is available only in Adobe Analytics. It is not visible in AEM Forms analytics reports. For these metrics, AEM Forms analytics reports display data which is captured after performing the upgrade.</p> </li> 
    </ul></li> 
   <li><p>Verify that the server is upgraded successfully, all the data is also migrated successfully, and it can operate normally.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Verify the status of the bundles: </strong>Ensure that all the bundles are in active state.<br /> </li> 
     <li><strong>Verify replication and reverse replication:</strong> Publish, fill, and submit a few migrated forms. Verify the submitted data also.</li> 
     <li><strong>Verify access to admin and developer user interfaces:</strong> Log in to AEM instance from an admin account and verify that you have access to the following URLs: 
      <ul> 
       <li>http://[server]:[port]/crx/packmgr</li> 
       <li>http://[server]:[port]/crx/de</li>

      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Direct upgrade from LiveCycle ES2, ES3, ES4, and AEM 6.0 Forms to AEM 6.3 Forms is not available. You can perform an intermediate upgrade to one or more versions of LiveCycle or AEM Forms and then upgrade from AEM 6.3 Forms. For the list of intermediate versions and corresponding upgrade instructions, see <a href="../../../forms/using/wip/upgrade-migrate.md#main-pars-header">Choose an upgrade path</a>.</p>
