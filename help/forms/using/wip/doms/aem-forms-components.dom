  <p>The adaptive form components let you create fields in which your customers enter information. Properties of a component let you customize the usability of a component. For example, you add a text box component in your form, and it adds a text field. You can use the properties such as title, required field message, and default value to customize how a user interacts with the field and provides details. </p> 
  <p>All the AEM Forms components that are available out-of-the-box are described below. Click a component to see how to use it. </p>
