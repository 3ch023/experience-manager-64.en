  <h2>Credit card application walkthrough</h2> 
  <p>The We.Finance credit card application scenario involves the following personas:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer</li> 
   <li>Gloria Rios, Head of Credit Card and Mortgage, We.Finance</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The following infographic depicts step-by-step workflow of the credit card application.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/workflow_aem.png" /> 
  <p>Let’s look at the reference site scenario in detail to understand how the AEM Forms helps We.Finance achieve their objectives.</p> 
  <h3>Sarah receives a newsletter from We.Finance and applies for a credit card</h3> 
  <p>Sarah Rose is an existing We.Finance customer. She receives a newsletter from We.Finance about new credit cards on offer. She finds the offers exciting and decides to apply for a credit card. She clicks the Apply Now button in the newsletter, which takes her to the credit card application on We.Finance portal. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/marketing-email.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The newsletter sent to Sarah is a custom implementation that triggers an email to the specified email ID. The Apply Now button in the email is linked to the credit card application, which is an adaptive form on a publish instance. </p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>Open the following URL on the publish instance to trigger a newsletter email. Ensure that you replace <span class="code">[emailID]</span> with a valid email account to receive the newsletter. Open the newsletter and click <span class="uicontrol">Apply Now</span> to go to the credit card application.</p> 
  <p><span class="code"><a title="Follow link">http://[publishServer]:[publsihPort]/content/campaigns/we-finance/start.html?app=cc&amp;email=[emailID]&amp;givenName=Sarah&amp;familyName=Rose</a></span></p> 
  <h3>Sarah finds the offer interesting and chooses to apply</h3> 
  <p>Sarah decides to apply for the credit card and taps <strong>Apply Now </strong>button on the email. It takes Sarah to the credit card application on We.Finance portal. The application form is organized in sections using a card layout.</p> 
  <p>Sarah selects a credit card from the available options and clicks <span class="uicontrol">Continue</span>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cc-application-form-desktop.png" /> 
  <p>On the Personal Information page, as Sarah provides her Social Security Number, she gets a prompt to log in with her credentials.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/login-ssn.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah is an existing We.Finance customer. She logs in with her We.Finance account credentials and her personal details are auto-populated in the form. Sarah continues to fill the application form and that’s when a reminder pops up for a meeting she must attend. She clicks <span class="uicontrol">Save my progress</span> on the application form. It saves all the information Sarah has filled in so far and a dialog pops up to confirm if she would like to receive an email with a link to her draft application to complete later.</p> 
  <p>Sarah clicks <span class="uicontrol">Send mail</span>. She receives an email with a link to resume her credit card application.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/resume.png" /> 
  <details> 
   <summary>Sarah accesses the credit card application from her mobile device</summary> 
   <p>If Sarah is accessing the credit card application from her mobile device, the responsive application opens in a view optimized for mobile devices. In this view, the application form is renders as one section at a time. It allows Sarah to view and provide information progressively as she navigates the application.</p> 
   <img alt="Filling the credit card application on mobile device" imageRotate="0" src="assets/form-on-mobile.png" title="Filling the credit card application on mobile device" /> 
  </details> 
  <details> 
   <summary>How it works</summary> 
   <p>The <strong>Apply Now</strong> button directs Sarah to the credit card application. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instances at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/cc-app.html</span>.</p> 
   <p>Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>It is based on an XSD schema.</li> 
    <li>It is built using We Finance Theme A for styling and We.Finance template for layout. Also, it uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance</span> and the theme at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/we-finance-theme-a/jcr:content</span>.</li> 
    <li>It includes adaptive form rules to invoke Form Data Model services to prefill user details of logged in user. It also invokes services to prefill information by social security number or email address provided in the form. You can review the Form Data Models and their services at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm</span>.</li> 
    <li>It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.</li> 
    <li>It uses the Signature Step component to display the completed form and allows electronic signature on the form.</li> 
    <li>The Save my progress button generates a unique ID for the user and saves the partially-filled application as a draft in a node in AEM repository. Also, it displays a dialog seeking permission to send an email with a link to the node containing the draft application. The Send mail button on the confirmation dialog triggers an email with a link to the node containing the draft.</li> 
    <li>It uses the Invoke AEM Workflow submit action to trigger the credit card approval workflow. You can review the workflow used in this form at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/we-finance-credit-card-workflow.html</span></li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.</p>

  <h3>Sarah resumes and submits the application</h3> 
  <p>Sarah comes back later and finds an email from We.Finance. She clicks the <strong>Resume</strong> button in the email that takes her to her draft credit card application. The information that she filled earlier comes prepopulated. She fills the remaining application form, signs the application, and submits it.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/resume-1.png" /> 
  <p>Alternatively, she can access her draft application under <strong>My Forms</strong> on We.Finance home page.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/portal-drafts.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The Resume button in the email redirects Sarah to the node containing her draft application.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>You must have received an email with a link to the draft application on your email ID that you specified while filling the application form. Go ahead, fill in the remaining sections in the application, and submit it.</p> 
  <h3 id="approving_the_application">We.Finance receives and approves the application</h3> 
  <p>We.Finance receives the credit card application submitted by Sarah. A task is assigned to Gloria Rios. She reviews the task in her AEM Inbox and approves it.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/inbox.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>When Sarah fills and submits the credit card application, a Forms Workflow triggers and a task is created in Gloria's AEM inbox. </p> 
  <p>AEM Forms on OSGi provides forms-centric workflows that allow you to build adaptive forms-based workflows. These workflows can be used for review and approvals, business process flows, to start document services, integrate with Adobe Sign signature workflow, and so on. For more information, see <a href="../../forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md" target="_blank">Forms-centric workflow on OSGi</a>.</p> 
  <p>The following image depicts the AEM workflow that processes the credit card application and generates a PDF output of the application.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/workflow.png" /> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>You can access AEM inbox for the we.finance site at http://&amp;lt;<em>hostname</em>&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;<em>PublishPort</em>&amp;gt;/content/we-finance/global/en.html. On the page, tap <strong>Sign In</strong>, select the<strong> Login as representative</strong> checkbox, log in to the AEM inbox using <span class="code">grios/password</span> as the username/password for Gloria Rios, and approve the credit card application. For information about using AEM Inbox for forms-centric workflow tasks, see <a href="../../forms/using/manage-applications-inbox.md" target="_blank">Manage Forms applications and tasks in AEM Inbox</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/inbox-1.png" /> 
  <p>When you approve the application, Sarah receives an email with the welcome kit. </p> 
  <h3>Sarah receives the welcome kit and applies for an add-on card</h3> 
  <p>As Sarah's credit card application gets approved, she receives an email with a link to the Welcome kit. She opens the Welcome kit, which includes her credit card account details. The Welcome kit also displays promotional offers personalized for Sarah. As she scrolls down, the Welcome kit contains an embedded form to apply for an add-on card. Sarah quickly filled in the required details from within the Welcome kit and applies for the add-on card. A confirmation dialog for the add-on card application appears.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/welcome-kit-for-sara.png" /> 
  <p>The welcome kit is personalized for Sarah and shows information relevant to her. It provides her an option to download a PDF version of the welcome kit. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/benefits-of-platinum-card.png" /> 
  <p>The welcome kit includes another application form that Sarah can fill and submit to apply for an add-on card from within the welcome kit without visiting the We.Finance portal.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/apply-addon-card.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The welcome kit is an interactive communication included in the <span class="code">cq-we-finance-content-pkg.zip</span> package. The interactive cards in the desktop version to showcase the benefits of the credit card in the welcome kit is a custom layout created using the default card layout of a document fragment.</p> 
  <p>The add-on card application is an embedded adaptive form in the welcome kit interactive communication.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>Click the Resume button in the email that you received in the previous step. It opens the draft application. Fill in all the details and submit the application. You will then receive a welcome kit. Review the welcome kit.</p> 
  <p>You can also view the welcome kit at the following URL:</p> 
  <p>http://<strong> &amp;lt;<em>host</em>&amp;gt;</strong>:<strong>&amp;lt;<em>port</em>&amp;gt;/</strong>content/aemforms-refsite/doclink.html?document=/content/forms/af/we-finance/credit-card/creditcardwelcomekit&amp;customerId=197&amp;channel=web</p> 
  <p>You can access it on author and publish instances. </p> 
  <h3>Sarah receives a credit card statement</h3> 
  <p>As Sarah begins to use the credit card, she receives another email from We.Finance that includes her credit card statement. The following images show the email with a link to the credit card statement on mobile.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/statement-email.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah clicks View Statement in the email to view the credit card statement. The statement is an interactive communication. It has both Web and Print (PDF) versions. The statement integrates with Forms Data Model to retrieve data, specific to the customer, from the database. The interactive statement constitutes various elements:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Statement summary</li> 
   <li>Detailed expense report</li> 
   <li>Graphical expense analysis</li> 
   <li>Option to make a payment for the due amount from within the statement</li> 
   <li>Download the payment receipt</li> 
  </ul> 
  <img alt="Different parts of the credit card statement" imageRotate="0" src="assets/sara-rose-statement.png" title="Different parts of the credit card statement" /> 
  <p>Sarah doesn’t need to go to the portal or search through her emails for PDF version of the credit card statement for offline archival. She just clicks the Download Statement to download a PDF version of the statement.</p> 
  <p>The detailed statement is laid out in a responsive table. The statement also provides option to pay a part or the entire due amount from within the statement.</p> 
  <img alt="Detailed statement" imageRotate="0" src="assets/statement-details.png" title="Detailed statement" /> 
  <p>Sarah schedules payment from within the statement. Sarah can also use the Flexi Pay option to divide payment into equal parts. </p> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The credit card statement is an interactive communication. The detailed expense table in the statement is a responsive table. The graphic for expense analysis is a chart component and reads the expense table and generates the pie chart.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>You can review the interactive credit card statement at the following URL:</p> 
  <p>http://&amp;lt;<em>hostname</em>&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;<em>port</em>&amp;gt;/content/aemforms-refsite/doclink.html?document=/content/forms/af/we-finance/credit-card/credit-card-statement&amp;customerId=197&amp;channel=web</p> 
  <p>You can access it on author and publish instances.</p> 
  <p>The credit card statement displays promotional offers towards the end of statement. You can integrate Adobe Target with AEM Forms Interactive Communication to deliver promotional targeted offers based on specific customer segments. To configure your interactive communication to use Adobe Target for customized and targeted offers, see <a href="../../forms/using/experience-targeting-forms.md">create targeted experiences</a>.<br /> </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/offers.png" /> 
  <h3>We.Finance analyzes the performance of the credit card application</h3> 
  <p>We.Finance, from time to time, reviews the performance of their credit card application to check for any issues that customers might be facing. They use this analysis to take informed decisions about the changes required in the credit card application to enhance the user experience, reduce abandonment rate of forms, and thereby improve conversion. They leverage the integration of AEM Forms with Adobe Analytics for their analysis. The following image depicts their analytics dashboard.</p> 
  <p>For more information about how to interpret the analytics dashboard, see <a href="../../forms/using/view-understand-aem-forms-analytics-reports.md" target="_blank">Viewing and understanding AEM Forms analytics reports</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cc-analytics.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The performance metrics for the credit card application form are tracked using Adobe Analytics. For more information about configuring Adobe Analytics and viewing reports, see <a href="../../forms/using/configure-analytics-forms-documents.md" target="_blank">Configuring analytics for forms and documents</a>.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself &lt;br&gt;</h4> 
  <p>For you to view and explore the analytics report, we are providing seed data for the credit card application in the reference site.

  </ol> 
  <p><strong>A/B testing of the credit card application</strong></p> 
  <p>In addition to analyzing performance of the credit card application and constantly improving it, We.Finance leverages integration of AEM Forms with Target to create A/B tests. It allows them to serve different experiences of the credit card application form and identify the experience that causes better conversion rate in terms of form completion and submission.</p> 
  <p>To configure Target in AEM Forms server, see <a href="../../forms/using/ab-testing-adaptive-forms.md#set%20up%20and%20integrate%20target%20in%20aem%20forms" target="_blank">Set up and integrate Target in AEM Forms</a>.</p> 
  <p>Perform the following steps to experience the creation of A/B test for We.Finance credit card application form:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Go to <strong>Forms &amp; Documents</strong> at http://&amp;lt;<em>hostname</em>&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;<em>AuthorPort</em>&amp;gt;/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments.</li> 
   <li>Click to open the <strong>We.Finance</strong> folder.</li> 
   <li>Select <strong>Application for Credit Card </strong>adaptive form.</li> 
   <li>Click <strong>More</strong> in toolbar and select <strong>Configure A/B Testing</strong>. The Configure A/B testing page opens.<br /> </li> 
   <li>Specify an <strong>Activity Name</strong>.</li>

   <li>In the <strong>Experience Distribution</strong> fields for experiences A and B, specify the distribution, in terms of percentage, to determine the distribution of experiences among the total audience. For example, if you specify 40, 60 for experiences A and B, respectively, the experience A will be served to the 40% of the audience and the remaining 60% will see the experience B.</li> 
   <li>Click <strong>Configure</strong>. A dialog appears to confirm the creation of the A/B test.</li> 
   <li>Click <strong>Done</strong>.</li> 
   <li>Select the <strong>Application for Credit Card</strong> form and click <strong>Edit</strong>. It gives the option to open one of the experiences. Click <strong>Experience B</strong>. The form opens in the edit mode.</li> 
   <li>Modify the form as desired to create a different experience than the default experience A.</li> 
   <li>Go to the Forms and Documents UI, select the form, click <strong>More</strong>, and select <strong>Start A/B Testing</strong>.</li> 
   <li>Now open the form in chrome browser several times using the following url:<br /> http://&amp;lt;<em>hostname</em>&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;<em>port</em>&amp;gt;/content/dam/formsanddocuments/we-finance/cc-app/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled<strong><em><br /> Note:</em></strong><em> Remove the cookie with the name <strong>mbox </strong>from browser’s cookie persistence before opening the form next time.</em><br /> You will see experience A and B of the form at random.</li>

  <h2>Home mortgage application walkthrough</h2> 
  <p>The We.Finance home mortgage scenario involves the following personas:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer</li> 
   <li>Gloria Rios, Head of Credit Card and Mortgage, We.Finance</li> 
   <li>John Doe, Customer Care Representative, We.Finance</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The following infographic depicts step-by-step workflow of a home mortgage application.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/home_mortgage_application_walkthrough.png" /> 
  <p>Let’s now look in detail the steps in the reference site scenario to see how the AEM Forms helps We.Finance achieve their objectives.</p> 
  <h3>Sarah visits We.Finance website and applies for home mortgage</h3> 
  <p>Sarah Rose is planning to buy a home and looking for a home mortgage plans. She is a We.Finance customer and therefore visits the We.Finance portal to explore home mortgage offers. She goes to the Loans section and finds a mortgage calculator on the portal. She fills in the details and clicks Calculate my mortgage, which returns a mortgage plan.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/loans1.png" /> 
  <img captionBottom="Mortgage calculator" imageRotate="0" src="assets/loans2.png" /> 
  <img captionBottom="Mortgage calculator result" imageRotate="0" src="assets/loans3.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The home mortgage calculator on the Loans page is an embedded adaptive form in AEM Sites page. You can review the Loans page in edit mode at <span class="code">http://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/we-finance/global/en/loan-landing-page.html</span>.</p> 
  <p>The embedded mortgage calculator, which is an adaptive form, uses rules to calculate the EMI amount based on the loan details provided in the calculator fields. You can review the adaptive form at <span class="code">http://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/hm-calc.html</span>.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>Go to We.Finance portal at <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;publishHost&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;publishPort&amp;gt;/content/we-finance/global/en.html</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Loans</span>. Provide details in the mortgage calculator and see the results.</p> 
  <h3>Sarah finds the offer interesting and chooses to apply</h3> 
  <p>Sarah chooses to apply for home mortgage and clicks <span class="uicontrol">Apply Now</span> on home mortgage calculator results. It opens the application for home mortgage.</p> 
  <p>If Sarah is accessing the home mortgage application from her mobile device, the application form opens in a view optimized for viewing on a mobile device. In this view, the application form renders one section at a time. It allows Sarah to view and provide information progressively as she navigates the application form.</p> 
  <p>The following images show the workflow as Sarah navigates through the home mortgage application on her mobile device.</p> 
  <img alt="Filling the mortgage application on mobile device" imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-form-on-mobile.png" title="Filling the mortgage application on mobile device" /> 
  <p>If Sarah clicks <strong>Apply now</strong> from her desktop, the mortgage application form opens as follows. The information Sarah provided in the mortgage calculator is prefilled in the application form. Sarah fills in the remaining details and clicks <strong>Continue</strong>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-application.png" /> 
  <p>Based on the information Sarah filled in the mortgage calculator, she is presented with a few mortgage plans. She chooses the plan that suits her requirements and continues to fill the application. She finally signs and submits the application.</p> 
  <p>The submitted application goes to We.Finance for approval.</p> 
  <img alt="Saving a draft application" imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-plans.png" title="Saving a draft application" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The <strong>Apply now</strong> button directs Sarah to the home mortgage application. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instances at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/hm-app.html</span>.</p> 
  <p>Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>It is based on an XSD schema, <span class="code">homeMortgageApplication.xsd</span>.</li> 
   <li>It is built using We Finance Theme B for styling and We.Finance template for layout. Also, it uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template and the theme used in the adaptive form at the following locations on your AEM author instance: 
    <ul> 
     <li><span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance</span></li> 
     <li><span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/we-finance-theme-b/jcr:content</span></li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>The first tab, Getting Started, in the application is a dynamic mortgage calculator that displays options based on user selection. For example, the fields and values are different for Purchase and Refinance options. This functionality is achieved using show-hide rules. In addition, when you click Continue and the Plans tab is initialized, it invokes a web service configured in a Form Data Model to fetch and display mortgage plans. You can review the Form Data Models and configured services at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm</span>.</li> 
   <li>It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.</li> 
   <li>It uses the Signature Step component to display the completed form and allows electronic signature on the form.</li> 
   <li>It uses the Invoke AEM Workflow submit action to trigger the We Finance Home Mortgage AEM workflow. You can review the workflow used in this form at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/we-finance-home-mortgage-workflow.html</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.</p>

  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>Go to<span class="code"> http://[server]:[port]/content/we-finance/global/en/all-forms.html</span> and click the <strong>Apply now</strong> button on Home Mortgage Application. Fill in the details in the Getting Started tab, try different options, and submit the application.</p> 
  <p>Ensure that you specify a valid email ID in the application to receive an acknowledgement mail in your inbox.</p> 
  <h3 id="approving_the_application">We.Finance receives the application</h3> 
  <p>We.Finance receives the mortgage application submitted by Sarah. The task to approve or reject the application is assigned to Gloria Rios. She reviews the application and finds that Sarah's government ID is missing.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/grios-inbox.png" /> 
  <p>Gloria opens the task and clicks Need More Info and puts a comment about missing government ID.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/need-more-info.png" /> 
  <p>The task is now assigned to John Doe, a customer care representative with We.Finance. He opens the task and reviews Gloria's comment. He contacts Sarah and asks her to send a copy of her ID. After he received a copy of Sarah's ID, he attaches it to the task and submits the application for re-evaluation.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/reevaluation.png" /> 
  <p>The task is reassigned to Gloria. She reviews the attached ID and approves the application. </p> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>When Sarah fills and submits the home mortgage application, a Forms Workflow triggers and a task is created in Gloria's AEM inbox. As Gloria reviews the application and requests for more information, the task is assigned to John Doe. When John Doe attaches the ID and resubmits the application, it is assigned to Gloria. This is defined in the AEM Workflow associated with the mortgage application.</p> 
  <p>AEM Forms on OSGi provides forms-centric workflows that allow you to build adaptive forms-based workflows. These workflows can be used for review and approvals, business process flows, to start document services, integrate with Adobe Sign signature workflow, and so on. For more information, see <a href="../../forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md" target="_blank">Forms-centric workflow on OSGi</a>.</p> 
  <p>The following image depicts the AEM workflow associated with the mortgage application.</p>

  <h3>Sarah receives the welcome kit</h3> 
  <p>As Sarah's mortgage application gets approved, she receives an email with a link to the Welcome kit. She opens the Welcome kit, which includes a carousel displaying promotional offers personalized for Sarah. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-welcome-kit.png" /> 
  <p>The welcome kit is personalized for Sarah and shows information relevant to her. It provides her an option to download a PDF version of the welcome kit. The arrow button at the bottom allows Sarah to scroll down and navigate through other sections in the welcome kit.</p> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The welcome kit is an interactive communication included in the <span class="code">cq-we-finance-content-pkg.zip</span> package. The promotional offers in the welcome kit are served by Adobe Target server. The offers are customized and targeted for specific customer segments. The welcome kit fetches offers from a preconfigured Adobe Target server for an audience segment of female customers.</p> 
  <p>The interactive cards in the desktop version of the welcome kit use a custom layout created using the default card layout of a document fragment.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>If you provided your email ID when filling the mortgage application, you should have received an email containing link to the welcome kit. Check your inbox and review the welcome kit.</p> 
  <p>You can view it in AEM publish instance at the following URL:</p> 
  <p><span class="code">http://[host]:[port]/content/forms/af/we-finance/mortgage-loan-welcome-kit.html</span></p> 
  <h3>Sarah receives an account statement</h3> 
  <p>As Sarah avails the loan and starts paying the installments, she receives another email from We.Finance that includes her monthly account statement. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-statement-email.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah clicks View Statement in the email to view the mortgage account statement. The interactive statement constitutes various elements:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Statement summary</li> 
   <li>Statement Details<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The following image shows different part of the account statement on Desktop. </p> 
  <img alt="Mortgage account statement" imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-statement.png" title="Mortgage account statement" /> 
  <p>The detailed statement is laid out in a responsive table and provides an option to pay a part or the entire due amount from within the statement.</p> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The mortgage statement is an interactive communication. It is generated using the JSON batching process. The detailed expense table in the statement is a responsive table. </p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4> 
  <p>You can review the interactive mortgage account statement at the following URL:</p> 
  <p>http://&amp;lt;<em>hostname</em>&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;<em>port</em>&amp;gt;/content/forms/af/we-finance/mortgage-account-statement.html?wcmmode=disabled</p> 
  <p>You can access it on author and publish instances. </p> 
  <h3>We.Finance analyzes the performance of the mortgage application</h3> 
  <p>We.Finance, from time to time, reviews the performance of their mortgage application to check for any issues that customers might be facing. They use this analysis to take informed decisions about the changes required in the mortgage application to enhance the user experience, reduce abandonment rate of forms, and thereby improve conversion. They leverage the integration of AEM Forms with Adobe Analytics for their analysis. The following image depicts their analytics dashboard.</p> 
  <p>For more information about how to interpret the analytics dashboard, see <a href="../../forms/using/view-understand-aem-forms-analytics-reports.md" target="_blank">Viewing and understanding AEM Forms analytics reports</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/mortgage-analytics.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The performance metrics for the mortgage application form are tracked using Adobe Analytics. For more information about configuring Adobe Analytics and viewing reports, see <a href="../../forms/using/configure-analytics-forms-documents.md" target="_blank">Configuring analytics for forms and documents</a>.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself &lt;br&gt;</h4> 
  <p>For you to view and explore the analytics report, we are providing seed data for the mortgage application in the reference site. Before you use seed data, see <a href="../../forms/using/setup-reference-sites.md#configureanalytics" target="_blank">Configure Analytics</a>.

  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/insurance-newsletter.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The newsletter sent to Sarah is a custom implementation that triggers an email to the specified email ID. The Apply Now button in the newsletter is linked to home insurance application, which is an adaptive form on a publish instance. </p>

  <h3>Sarah finds the home insurance offer interesting and chooses to apply</h3> 
  <p>Sarah likes the home insurance plan in the newsletter and decides to apply for it. She clicks Apply Now on the newsletter, which opens the home insurance application on We.Finance portal. The application form is organized in sections using a card layout.</p> 
  <p>On the Personal Information page, as Sarah provides her Social Security Number, she gets a prompt to log in with her credentials.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/insurance-ssn.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah is an existing We.Finance customer. She logs in with her We.Finance account credentials and her personal details are auto-populated in the form. She continues to fill and submit the application.</p> 
  <p>If Sarah submitted the application on a mobile device, she would go through the following screens.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/insurance-form-on-mobile.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The <strong>Apply Now</strong> button on the newsletter directs Sarah to the home insurance application on We.Finance portal. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instance at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/insurance/application-for-insurance.html</span>.</p> 
  <p>Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>It is based on an XSD schema, <span class="code">insurance.xsd</span>.</li> 
   <li>It is built using Insurance theme for styling and uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance</span> and the theme at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/insurance/jcr:content</span>.</li> 
   <li>It includes adaptive form rules to invoke Form Data Model services to prefill user details of logged in user. It also invokes services to prefill information by social security number or email address provided in the form. You can review the Form Data Models and their services at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm</span>.</li> 
   <li>It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.</li> 
   <li>The Save my progress button generates a unique ID for the user and saves the partially-filled application as a draft in a node in AEM repository. Also, it displays a dialog seeking permission to send an email with a link to the node containing the draft application. The Send mail button on the confirmation dialog triggers an email with a link to the node containing the draft.</li> 
   <li>It uses the Invoke AEM Workflow submit action to trigger the home insurance approval workflow. You can review the workflow used in this form at <span class="code">http://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/we-finance-insurance-workflow.html</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.</p>

  <h2>Wealth management prospectus walkthrough</h2> 
  <p>The We.Finance Wealth Management scenario involves the following persona:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Wealth Management walkthrough demonstrates how a We.Finance customer can use the site to learn about a mutual fund, the Blue Chip Growth Fund. The reference site uses an interactive communication to display information about the fund. The information is available in both web and PDF formats. The walkthrough ends with customer emailing the PDF version of the information to her brother.</p>

She goes to the Wealth Management section and opens the We.Finance Blue Chip Growth Fund page. The page contains links to prospectus which contain details about the current and historical prices, monthly performance, sector-wise diversification, expenses, fees, tax, and more information about the funds.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/slide1.png" /> 
  <h4>How it works</h4> 
  <p>The Blue Chip Growth Fund prospectus is an interactive communication. It uses texts, images, charts, and table components (document fragments) to display product summary, stock style, fund performance, fund details and other related information. You can review the interactive communication in the edit mode at http://[authorHost]:[ authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/wealth-management/wealth-management/channels/web.html</p> 
  <p>The charts and tables retrieve data from a form data model. The form data model connects to configured datasources, a database in this walkthrough, to retrieve information specific to the fund. You can review the form data model at http://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/aem/fdm/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm/we-finance/wealth-management</p>

  <p>The layout of the parent tab is set to Tabs on Top to convert all the child panels to tabs. You can review the panels of the interactive communication in the edit mode at http://[authorHost]:[ authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/wealth-management/wealth-management/channels/web.html.</p>
