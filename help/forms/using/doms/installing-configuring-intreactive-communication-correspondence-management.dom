  <h2>Introduction</h2> 
  <p>AEM Form has a capability to centralize creation, assembly, management and delivery of secure, and interactive documents such as business correspondences, documents, statements, benefit notices, marketing mails, bills, and welcome kits. This capability is known as interactive communication. The capability is included in AEM Forms add-on package. The add-on package is deployed on an Author or Publish instance of AEM.</p> 
  <p>You can use the interactive communication capability to produce communication in multiple formats. For example, web and PDF. You can integrate interactive communication with AEM Workflow to process and deliver the assembled communication to customers on the channel of their choice. For example, sending a communication to end user through email.</p> 
  <p>If you are upgrading from a previous version and have already invested in correspondence management, you can install the <a href="../../forms/using/installing-configuring-intreactive-communication-correspondence-management.md#main-pars-header-374258416">compatibility package</a> to continue using correspondence management. For information about the differences between interactive communication and correspondence management, see <a href="../../forms/using/interactive-communications-overview.md#main-pars-header-1771713575">Interactive Communication Overview</a>.<br /> </p> 
  <p>AEM Forms is a powerful enterprise-class platform. Interactive communication is only one of the capability of AEM Forms. For the complete list of capabilities, see <a href="../../forms/using/introduction-aem-forms.md">Introduction to AEM Forms</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Deployment Topology</h2> 
  <p>AEM Forms add-on package is an application deployed onto AEM. You require only a minimum of one AEM Author and Processing instance to run the Interactive Communications capability. The following topology is indicative topology to run AEM Forms Interactive Communications, Correspondence Management, AEM Forms data capture, and Forms-Centric workflow on OSGi capabilities. For detailed information about the topology, see <a href="../../forms/using/aem-forms-architecture-deployment.md">Architecture and deployment topologies for AEM Forms</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/recommended-topology.png" /> 
  <p>AEM Forms Interactive Communications run admin, authoring, and agent user interfaces on the Author instances of AEM Forms. The Publish instances host final version of interactive communications which are ready for consumption by end-users.</p> 
  <h2>System Requirements</h2> 
  <p>Before you begin to install and configure interactive communication and correspondence management capabilities of AEM Forms, ensure that:</p> 
  <ul>

  <h2>Post-installation configurations</h2> 
  <p>AEM Forms has a few mandatory and optional configurations. The mandatory configurations include configuring BouncyCastle libraries and serialization agent. The optional configurations include configuring dispatcher and Adobe Target. </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <h3>Mandatory post-installation configurations</h3> 
  <h4>Configure RSA and BouncyCastle libraries </h4> 
  <p>Perform the following steps on all the Author and Publish instances to boot delegate the libraries: </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Stop the underlying AEM instance.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Open the [AEM installation directory]\crx-quickstart\conf\sling.properties file for editing.</p> <p>If you used [AEM installation directory]\crx-quickstart\bin\start.bat to start AEM, then edit the sling.properties located at [AEM_root]\crx-quickstart\.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Add the following properties to the sling.properties file:<br /> <br /> </p> 
    <codeblock gutter="true" class="syntax js">
      sling.bootdelegation.class.com.rsa.jsafe.provider.JsafeJCE=com.rsa.*!!discoiqbr!!sling.bootdelegation.class.org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider=org.bouncycastle.* 
    </codeblock></li> 
   <li><p>Save and close the file and start the AEM instance.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Repeat steps 1-4 on all the Author and Publish instances. <br /> </p> </li>  
  </ol> 
  <h4>Configure the serialization agent</h4> 
  <p>Perform the following steps on all the Author and Publish instances to whitelist the package:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Open AEM Configuration Manager in a browser window. The default URL is http://[server]:[port]/system/console/configMgr.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Search and open <strong>Deserialization Firewall Configuration</strong>.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Add the <strong>sun.util.calendar </strong>package to the <strong>whitelist </strong>field. Click Save.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Repeat steps 1-3 on all the Author and Publish instances.<br /> </p> </li>  
  </ol> 
  <h3>Optional post-installation configurations</h3> 
  <h4>Install Compatibility Package</h4> 
  <p>Interactive communication is the default and recommended approach to create customer communications in AEM 6.4 Forms. If you have upgraded or migrated from a previous version, and plan to continue using letters (Correspondence Management), install the <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq640/fd/AEM-FORMS-6.4-COMPAT">AEMFD Compatibility package</a>.</p> 
  <p>The AEMFD Compatibility package allows you to use the following assets from AEM 6.3 Forms and AEM 6.2 Forms on AEM 6.4 Forms:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Document fragments<br /> </li> 
   <li>Letters</li> 
   <li>Data dictionaries</li> 
   <li>Adaptive forms deprecated templates and pages</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Configure Dispatcher</h4> 
  <p>Dispatcher is caching and load balancing tool for AEM. AEM Dispatcher also helps to protect AEM server from attacks. You can increase the security of your AEM instance by using the Dispatcher in conjunction with an enterprise-class web server. If you use <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/dispatcher/using/dispatcher-configuration.html">Dispatcher</a>, then perform the following configurations for AEM Forms:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Configure access for AEM Forms:</p> <p>Open the dispatcher.any file for editing. Navigate to the filter section and add the following filter to the filter section:</p>  <p>Save and Close the file. For detailed information about filters, see <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/dispatcher/using/dispatcher-configuration.html">Dispatcher documentation</a>.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Configure the referrer filter service:</p> <p>Log in to the Apache Felix configuration manager as an administrator. The Default URL of the configuration manager is http://[server]:[port_number]/system/console/configMgr. In the <strong>Configurations </strong>menu, select the <strong>Apache Sling Referrer Filter</strong> option. In the Allow Hosts field, enter host name of the dispatcher to allow it as a referrer and click <strong>Save</strong>. The format of the entry is http://[server]:[port].</p>  </li>    
  </ol>      
  <h4>Integrate Adobe Target</h4> 
  <p>Your customers are likely to abandon an interactive communication if the experience it delivers is not engaging. While it is frustrating for the customers, it can also upturn the support volume and cost for your organization. It is critical and challenging to identify and provide the right customer experience that increases the conversion rate. AEM forms holds the key to this problem.</p> 
  <p>AEM forms integrates with Adobe Target, an Adobe Marketing Cloud solution, to deliver personalized and engaging customer experiences across multiple digital channels. To use Adobe Target to personalize an interactive communication, <a href="../../forms/using/ab-testing-adaptive-forms.md#setupandintegratetargetinaemforms" target="_blank">Integrate Adobe Target with AEM Forms</a>. </p> 
  <h4>Configure SSL communcation for Form Data Model </h4> 
  <p>You can enable SSL communication for Form Data Model. To enable SSL communication for Form data model, before starting any AEM Forms instance, add certificates to Java Trust Store of all the instances. You can run the below command to add the certificates: </p> 
  <p><span class="code">keytool -import -alias &amp;lt;alias-name&amp;gt; -file &amp;lt;pathTo .cer certificate file&amp;gt; -keystore &amp;lt;&amp;lt;pathToJRE&amp;gt;\lib\security\cacerts&amp;gt;</span></p>
