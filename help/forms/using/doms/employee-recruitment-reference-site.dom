  <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
  <p>Set up the reference sites as described in <a href="../../forms/using/setup-reference-sites.md" target="_blank">Set up and configure AEM Forms reference sites</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>We.Finance is an organization that allows candidates to apply for employment through the reference site portal. The organization also uses the portal to manage candidates' interviewing scheduling, shortlisting, and internal communication. The site manages the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Candidates searching and applying for jobs</li> 
   <li>Screening and shortlisting of candidates</li> 
   <li>Interviewing process<br /> </li> 
   <li>Collection of candidate details</li> 
   <li>Candidate background checking</li> 
   <li>Rolling out offers to selected candidates</li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>Employee recruitment use cases are available in both We.Finance and We.Gov reference sites. The examples, images, and descriptions used in the walkthroughs use We.Finance reference site. However, you can run these use cases and review artifacts using We.Gov as well. To do so, replace <strong>we-finance</strong> with <strong>we-gov</strong> in the mentioned URLs.</p> 
  </note>
  <h3>Workflow models involved</h3>
  <p>The employee recruitment use case involves two workflows:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Before the interview - We Finance Employee Recruiting workflow</li> 
   <li>After the interview - We Finance Employee Recruiting Post Interview workflow</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>These workflows are created in AEM and can be found at:</p> 
  <p><span class="kbd">http://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/libs/cq/workflow/admin/console/content/models.html/etc/workflow/models/</span></p> 
  <h4>We Finance Employee Recruiting workflow</h4>

  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/we-finance-employee-recruiting-workflow.png" />
  <h4>We Finance Employee Recruiting Post Interview workflow</h4>
  <p>Following is the model of the We Finance Employee Post Interview Recruiting workflow followed in this document.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/we-finance-employee-recruiting-post-interview-workflow.png" />
  <h3>Personas</h3>
  <p>The scenario involves the following personas:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, the candidate applying for a job at the organization</li> 
   <li>John Jacobs, the recruiter</li> 
   <li>Gloria Rios, the hiring manager</li> 
   <li>John Doe, the HR person</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Sarah applies for a job</h2>
  <p>Sarah Rose is looking for a job opportunity in the organization. She visits their web portal and explores the job openings listed on the Career page. She finds a matching job listing and applies for it.</p> 
  <img captionBottom="We.Finance home page" imageRotate="0" src="assets/home-page.png" />
  <img captionBottom="We.Finance career page" imageRotate="0" src="assets/career-page.png" />
  <p>Sarah clicks Apply on a job posting. The job application form opens. She fills all the details in the application and submits it.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/job-application-form.png" />
  <h4>How it works</h4>
  <p>The We.Finance home page and the career page are AEM Sites pages. The career page embeds an adaptive form, which uses a repeatable panel to fetch job openings using a service and list them on the page. You can review the adaptive form at <span class="code">http://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/employee/recruitment/jobs.html</span>.</p> 
  <h4>See it yourself</h4>
  <p>Go to <span class="code">http://[publishHost]:[publishPort]/content/we-finance/global/en.html</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Career</span>. Click <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> to populate the job list and then click <span class="uicontrol">Apply</span> for a job. Fill details in the form and submit the application.</p> 
  <p>Ensure that you specify a valid email ID in the application as any communication through this walkthrough will be sent to the specified email ID.</p>
