  <p>AEM Forms let you create, publish, and unpublish forms easily. For more information about AEM Forms, see <a href="../../forms/using/introduction-managing-forms.md" target="_blank">Introduction to managing forms</a>.</p> 
  <p>The AEM Forms server provides two instances: Author and Publish. Author instance is for creating and managing form assets and resources. Publish instance is for keeping assets and related resources that are available for end users. You can import XDP and PDF forms in the Author mode. For more information, see <a href="../../forms/using/get-xdp-pdf-documents-aem.md">Getting XDP and PDF documents in AEM Forms</a>. <br /> </p> 
  <h2>Supported assets &amp;nbsp;</h2> 
  <p>AEM Forms support the following types of assets: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Adaptive forms</li> 
   <li>Adaptive documents<br /> </li> 
   <li>Adaptive form fragments</li> 
   <li>Themes</li> 
   <li>Form templates (XFA forms)</li> 
   <li>PDF forms</li> 
   <li>Document (Flat PDF documents)</li> 
   <li>Form Sets</li> 
   <li>Resource (Images, Schemas, and Stylesheets)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Initially, all the assets are available only in the Author instance. An administrator or form author can publish all the assets except resources. </p>  
  <p>When you select a form and publish it, its related assets and resources are also published. However, dependent assets are not published. In this context, related assets and resources are assets that a published asset uses or refers to. Dependent assets are assets that refer to a published asset.</p> 
  <p>Your Adaptive Forms may utilize some configutaions, settings, and customizations that are not automatically published. It is recommended that you publish or activate these resources before you publish an adaptive form.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Editable Adaptive Form Templates</li> 
   <li>Cloud Service configutaions for Adobe Sign, Typekit, reCAPTCHA, and Form Data Models</li> 
   <li>Other Cloud services configations are only activated if the user has admin permissions.</li> 
   <li>Customizations. These include but are not limited to: 
    <ul> 
     <li>Custom layouts</li> 
     <li>Custom appearances</li> 
     <li>CSS File - taken as input in Adaptive Form container properties dialog</li> 
     <li>Client Library Category - taken as input in Adaptive Form container properties dialog</li> 
     <li>Ay other client library which may been included as part of Adaptive Form template.</li> 
     <li>Design Paths</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Asset states</h2> 
  <p>An asset can have the following states:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Unpublished: </strong>An asset that has never been published (The unpublished state is applicable only to Forms assets. Correspondence Management assets do not have an Unpublished state.) </li> 
   <li><strong>Published</strong>: An asset that has been published and is available on the Publish instance</li> 
   <li><strong>Modified</strong>: An asset that is modified after being published </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Publish an asset</h2> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Log in to the AEM Forms server. </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Use one of the following to select and publish an asset.</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li><p>Move the pointer over an asset and tap <span class="uicontrol">Publish </span><img height="16" src="assets/aem6forms_globe.pngasset.png" width="16" />.</p> </li> 
     <li><p>Do one of following and then tap Publish:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>If you are in the card view, tap <strong><span class="uicontrol">Enter Selection</span> </strong><img height="16" src="assets/aem6forms_check-circle.png" width="16" />, and tap the asset. The asset is selected.</li> 
       <li>If you are in the list view, select the checkbox of an asset. The asset is selected.<br /> </li> 
       <li>Tap an asset to display its details.</li> 
       <li>Display an asset's properties by tapping View Properties <img src="assets/viewproperties.png" />.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <note> 
       <p>Do not select multiple assets. Publishing multiple assets at once is not supported. </p> 
      </note></li> 
    </ol></li> 
   <li><p>When the Publish process starts, a confirmation dialog appears listing all the related assets and resources. In the dialog box that contains related assets, tap <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span>. The asset is published and the Publish Assets Success dialog appears. </p> 
    <note> 
     <p>For the Adaptive forms, along with the related assets, the Adaptive Form page name is also displayed.</p> 
    </note><img alt="A confirmation dialog with all the related assets and resources" captionBottom="A confirmation dialog with all the related assets and resources." imageRotate="0" src="assets/p4.png" title="A confirmation dialog with all the related assets and resources" /> 
    <note> 
     <p>For Forms Manager, if the user does not have permission to publish the listed assets, the Publish action is disabled. An asset that requires extra permissions is shown in red. </p> 
    </note><p>After an asset is published, metadata properties of the asset are copied to the Publish instance and the status of the asset is changed to Published. The status of dependent assets that are published is also changed to Published.</p> <p>After publishing an asset, you can use the Forms Portal to display all the assets on a web page. For more information, see <a href="../../forms/using/introduction-publishing-forms.md" target="_blank">Introduction to publishing forms on a portal</a>.</p> </li> 
  </ol>

  <h2>Automate publishing and unpublishing for Forms &amp;amp; Documents</h2>

    </note></li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Protected adaptive forms</h2>
