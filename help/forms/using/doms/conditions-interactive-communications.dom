  <h2>Overview</h2> 
  <p>Condition is a document fragment that you can include in an Interactive Communication. The other document fragments are <a href="../../forms/using/texts-interactive-communications.md" target="_blank">text</a>, list, and layout fragment. Conditions enable you to define one or more contextual assets that get included in an Interactive Communication based on the supplied data and rules.</p> 
  <p>Examples:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>In a credit card statement, display the credit card annual fee and credit card image based on the type of customer's credit card.</li> 
   <li>In an insurance premium due reminder, display calculations of tax based on the customer's state's taxes.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The assets in the conditions that are rendered based on the applied rules and the values passed to the rule. The rules in the conditions can check values in the following types of data:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Associated form data model's property</li> 
   <li>Any variables that you create in the condition<br /> </li> 
   <li>Strings</li> 
   <li>Numbers</li> 
   <li>Mathematical expressions</li> 
   <li>Dates</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2 id="CreateCondition">Create condition</h2> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Select <span class="uicontrol">Forms</span> &amp;gt; <span class="uicontrol">Document Fragments</span>. </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select <span class="uicontrol">Create</span> &amp;gt; <span class="uicontrol">Condition</span>. </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Specify the following information:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><span class="uicontrol">Title</span>: (Optional) Enter the title for the condition. Titles need not be unique and can have special characters and non-english characters. Conditions are referred by their titles (when available) such as in thumbnails and properties. </li> 
     <li><span class="uicontrol">Name</span>: The unique name for the condition, within a folder. No two document fragments (text, condition, or list) in any state can exist with the same name within a folder. In the Name field, you can enter only English language characters, numbers, and hyphens. The Name field is automatically populated based on the Title field. The special characters, spaces, numbers, and non-English characters entered in the Title field are replaced with hyphens in the Name field. Although the value in the Title field is automatically copied to the Name, you can edit the value.<br /> </li> 
     <li><span class="uicontrol">Description</span>: Type a description of the document fragment.</li> 
     <li><span class="uicontrol">Form Data Model</span>: Optionally, select the Form Data Model radio button to create the condition based on a form data model. When you select Form Data Model radio button, <span class="uicontrol">Form Data Model*</span> field appears. Browse and select a form data model. While creating condition for an Interactive Communication, ensure that you use the same data model that you intend to use in the Interactive Communication. For more information on form data model, see <a href="../../forms/using/data-integration.md" target="_blank">Data Integration</a>. </li> 
     <li><span class="uicontrol">Tags</span>: Optionally, to create custom tag enter value in text field and tap Enter. When you save this condition, the newly added tags get created.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>. </p> <p>Create Condition page appears. </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/createcondition.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Tap <span class="uicontrol">Add Assets</span>. </p> <p>Select Assets page appears and displays the available texts, lists, conditions, and images that are available for adding in the condition. </p> 
    <note> 
     <p>Only none-based, newly-created assets and FDM-based assets (created using same FDM as the condition being created) appear in the Select Assets page.</p> 
    </note></li> 
   <li><p>Tap on the appropriate assets to select them to include in the condition and then tap <span class="uicontrol">Done</span>.</p> <p>Create Condition page appears and lists the added assets. </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/createconditionassetsadd.png" /><p>You can use the following options to manage assets in a condition:</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/createconditionscreenassetsaddedannotated.png" /><p><strong>[A] Reject Change.</strong> Tap this icon to reject the changes you may have made to the asset and the rule in the condition. </p> <p><strong>[B] Accept Change.</strong> Tap this icon to accept the changes you have made in the asset and rule in the condition. </p> <p><strong>[C] Duplicate Asset.</strong> Tap this icon to create a copy of the asset along with the applied rule, if any, in the condition. Then you can proceed to editing the rule and asset for duplicated asset. Duplicating an asset is useful for creating similar rules to display alternate assets based on a particular context.</p> <p><strong>[D] Show Preview.</strong> Tap this icon to display a preview of the asset within the Create\Edit Condition page. </p> <p><strong>[E] Reorder.</strong> Tap and hold this icon to drag-and-drop assets to reorder them within a condition. </p>  <p>You can select the following options to specify how the condition behaves at runtime:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Multiple Results Evaluation Disabled\Multiple Results Evaluation Enabled</strong>: When this option is enabled (appears as "Multiple Results Evaluation Enabled"), all the rules are evaluated and the result is the sum of all the true rules. If this option is disabled (appears as "Multiple Results Evaluation Disabled") then only the first rule that is found to be true is evaluated and becomes the output of the condition.<br /> </li> 
     <li><strong>Page Break</strong>: Select this option (<img src="assets/break.png" />) to add a page break between the assets of the conditions. When this option is not selected (<img src="assets/nobreak.png" />), if a condition is overflowing to the next page in the print output, the whole condition is shifted to the next page instead of breaking in the page between the assets in the condition.<br /> </li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap <span class="uicontrol">Create Rule</span> to add rules to display or hide the assets, as required. To use variables in the rules, see <a href="#variables">creating variables</a>. For more information, see <a href="#ruleeditor">Adding rules to condition</a>. </p> <p>The created rules appear in the RULE column in the Create Condition screen.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/createconditionscreenrulesadded.png" /> 
    <note> 
     <p>You can insert assets in your condition that already have rules or repeat applied. </p> 
    </note></li> 
   <li><p>Tap <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</p> <p>The condition is created. Now you can proceed to using the condition as a building block while creating an Interactive Communication. </p> 
    <note> 
     <p>To save a new or edited condition, you must have at least one rule for each of assets added in the condition.</p> 
    </note></li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Edit a condition</h2> 
  <p>You can edit a condition using the following steps. You can also choose to edit a condition from within an Interactive Communication by selecting Edit Fragment in the popup menu. </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Select <span class="uicontrol">Forms</span> &amp;gt; <span class="uicontrol">Document Fragments</span>. </p> </li>
