  <h2>Pre-requisite</h2> 
  <p>Set up your We.Gov reference site as described in the <a href="../../forms/using/setup-reference-sites.md">Set up and configure AEM Forms reference sites</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Reference site Freedom of Information Act scenario</h2> 
  <p>We.Gov is a state run organization that lets adoptive parents enroll for child support if they adopted a child. We.Gov also allows parents to request information from the following government departments under the freedom of information act:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Defense Logistics Agency</li> 
   <li>Department of Defense Office of Inspector General</li> 
   <li>Department of Justice - Office of Information Policy</li> 
   <li>Department of the Navy</li> 
   <li>Environmental Protection Agency</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For more information on the Freedom Of Information Act, see <a href="http://www.foia.gov" target="_blank">www.foia.gov</a>.</p> 
  <p>The scenario involves the following personas:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, the person requesting information under </li> 
   <li>John Jacobs, the person who handles the request the forwards it to the appropriate department</li> 
   <li>Gloria Rios, the government employee who furnishes the information as per the request</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Sarah initiates request for information under FOIA</h2> 
  <p>Under the Freedom of Information Act, Sarah requests for copy of the Administration for Children and Families case logs for years (FY) 2013 through 2016. Sarah submits this request to the Departent of Justice - Office Of Information Policy and also signifies that she is willing to pay up to USD 100 for the printing and postage costs.</p> 
  <h3>How it works</h3>  
  <h3>See it yourself</h3> 
  <p>In your browser, open <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;PublishPort&amp;gt;/wegov</span>. In the We.Gov site, tap Applications &amp;gt; All Applications. In the All Applications page, tap Apply under Application for FOIA Request.</p>  
  <h2>Sarah starts her application for information under FOIA</h2> 
  <p>Sarah clicks <strong>Apply</strong> and in the Freedom of Information Act Request Form page, Sarah enters information including the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Agency: </strong>Sarah specifies the agency to which the request was addressed as Department of Justice - Office of Information Policy<strong>. </strong></li> 
   <li><strong>Will Pay Up To</strong>: Sarah specifies that she is willing to pay up to USD 100 for printing and postage expenses. </li> 
   <li><strong>Describe the request in detail</strong>: Sarah specifies "Requesting copy of the Administration for Children and Families case logs for fiscal years 2013 through 2016." </li> 
  </ul>

  <img alt="Requesting copy of the Administration for Children and Families case logs for fiscal years 2013 through 2016" captionBottom="Requesting copy of the Administration for Children and Families case logs for fiscal years 2013 through 2016" imageRotate="0" src="assets/sarahfiosform.png" title="Requesting copy of the Administration for Children and Families case logs for fiscal years 2013 through 2016" /> 
  <p>At any time, Sarah can tap save to Save the draft of the form and come back later to fill up the form and submit it. Sarah submits the form.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>The resume-from-email workflow works with logged in users only. In the reference site scenario, ensure that the user Sarah Rose is added. Sarah's login credentials are <span class="code">srose/password</span>. </p> 
  </note> 
  <h2>John Jacobs receives and approves the application</h2>
