  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The blog feature for AEM Communities has transformed from an authoring activity to a true community activity that takes place in the publish environment.</p> 
  <p>The blog feature supports providing community information in a journaling format. Blog entries are made in the publish environment by authorized members (registered, signed-in users).</p> 
  <p>The blog feature provides :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Publish-side creation of blog articles and comments</li> 
   <li>Rich text editing</li> 
   <li>Inline images (with support for drag and drop)</li> 
   <li>Embedded social networking content (<a href="../../communities/using/blog-developer-basics.md#allowingrichmedia">oEmbed support</a>)</li> 
   <li>Draft mode</li> 
   <li>Scheduled publishing</li> 
   <li>Compose on-behalf (a <a href="../../communities/using/users.md#privilegedmembersgroup">privileged member</a> can create content on behalf of a different communty member)</li> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/moderate-ugc.md">In-context and bulk moderation</a> of blog articles and comments</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This section of the documentation describes</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>adding the blog feature to an AEM site</li> 
   <li>configuration settings for blog components</li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>The components <span class="code">Journal </span>and <span class="code">Journal Sidebar</span> are titled <span class="code">Blog</span> and <span class="code">Blog Sidebar</span>. </p> 
   <p>The blog feature found in AEM 6.0 and earlier releases is now removed. It was based on a template and only allowed authors to create content in the author environment.</p> 
  </note>
  <h2>Adding Blog Components to a Page</h2>
  <p>If it is desired to add a blog to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span class="code">Communities / Blog</span></li> 
   <li><span class="code">Communities / Blog Sidebar</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>and drag them into place on a page where the blog should appear.</p> 
  <p>For necessary information, visit <a href="../../communities/using/basics.md">Communities Components Basics</a>.</p> 
  <p>When the <a href="../../communities/using/blog-developer-basics.md#essentialsforclientside">required client-side libraries</a> are included, this is how the <span class="code">Blog </span>component will appear :</p>
