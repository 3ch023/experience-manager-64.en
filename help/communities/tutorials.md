# Tutorials{#tutorials}

These are examples to help in learning and working with AEM 6.1 Communities [social component framework (SCF)](/help/communities/scf.md).

## Client-Side Customization {#client-side-customization}

See also [SCF client-side customization](/help/communities/client-customize.md).

* [Community Components guide](/help/communities/components-guide.md)

* [Overlay Comments Component](/help/communities/overlay-comments.md)

* [Extend Comments Component](/help/communities/extend-comments.md)

## Server-Side Customization {#server-side-customization}

See also [SCF server-side customization](/help/communities/server-customize.md).

* [Customize SCF Component Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-scf-sample-components-customize)

* [Overlay SCF Component Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-scf-sample-components-overlay)

* [Create a Sample Page](/help/communities/create-sample-page.md)

## Demo Users {#demo-users}

The Geometrixx samples package includes demo users. There is often a difference in experience between being a visitor (not logged in) or a member (logged in) and, as long as the Geometrixx samples packages remain installed, you may use these users to simulate a logged in state when exploring with the [Community Components guide](/help/communities/components-guide.md).

For a full list of the demo users, navigate using the Rail to **Tools &gt; Operations &gt; Security &gt; Users**. Or use the Classic UI [security console](http://localhost:4502/useradmin) for managing users and groups.

If a [community ste has been created](/help/communities/getting-started.md), it is possible to assign demo users to its [community user groups](/help/communities/users.md).
