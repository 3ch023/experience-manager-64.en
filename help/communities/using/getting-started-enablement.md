# Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement{#getting-started-with-aem-communities-for-enablement}

AEM Communities helps brands create consistent experiences across digital and in-person channels by facilitating enablement across employees and customers with a catalog of enablement resources, assigned content, and dynamic recommendationsâ€”all delivered within a social community to foster engagement.

Following is a tutorial on quickly setting up an [enablement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#enablementcommunity) for demonstration or development purposes.
