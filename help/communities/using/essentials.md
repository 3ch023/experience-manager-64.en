# Component, Function and Feature Essentials{#component-function-and-feature-essentials}

AEM Communities features require site visitors to become members and login to the [community site](../../communities/using/overview.md#communitiessites) before being able to post content. Thus, [community site templates](../../communities/using/sites.md), from which a community site is [created](../../communities/using/sites-console.md), are designed to include a login feature as well as user profiles, messaging, search, moderation, and translation.

A community site will support members creating community groups when the [community groups function](../../communities/using/functions.md#groupsfunction) is included in the selected community site template.

Following are links to essential information for Communities components, functions and features.
