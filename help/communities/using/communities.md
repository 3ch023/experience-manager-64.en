# Developing Communities{#developing-communities}

## Overview {#overview}

AEM Communities simplifies the creation and customizaton of community features such as forums, user groups, blogs, Q&A, calendars, comments, reviews, voting, ratings, and assignments. These features result in user generated content (UGC) being entered in the publish environment.

The foundation of a [community site](../../communities/using/overview.md#communitiessites) is the [social component framework](../../communities/using/scf.md) (SCF). Creation of a community site begins with the selection of a [community site template](../../communities/using/sites-console.md) that is composed of [community functions](../../communities/using/functions.md).

For an overview and getting started tutorials, visit :

* [AEM Communities Overview](../../communities/using/overview.md)
* [Getting Started with AEM Communities](../../communities/using/getting-started.md)
* [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](../../communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md)
