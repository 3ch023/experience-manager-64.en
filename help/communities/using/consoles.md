# Communities Consoles{#communities-consoles}

The AEM Communities consoles, available in the author environment from the global navigation panel, provides access to administrative tasks such as

* [creating a community site](/help/communities/using/sites-console.md)
* adding [groups](/help/communities/using/groups.md) nested within the site
* managing [community site templates](/help/communities/using/sites.md)
* managing [community members](/help/communities/using/members.md)
* [moderating](/help/communities/using/moderate-ugc.md) user generated content (UGC)
* create [custom badges](/help/communities/using/badges.md)
* configuring the [default storage for UGC](/help/communities/using/srp-config.md)

When [UGC storage](/help/communities/using/working-with-srp.md) is configured to be a common store shared by author and publish environments, the [moderation console](/help/communities/using/moderation.md), available from both author and publish environments, operates on a solitary instance of UGC.

In the author environment, after signing in with administrator privileges, the `Communities` consoles are available from the navigation and tools consoles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the publish environment, a [community site](/help/communities/using/sites-console.md) will display an `Administration`menu item when the signed in member has appropriate privileges.

  The Sites console is accessible in the author environment for the purpose of creating and managing community sites and its [groups](/help/communities/using/groups.md).

* [Moderation](/help/communities/using/moderation.md)  
  The Moderation console is for bulk moderation of UGC and in the author environment. A similar bulk moderation console is accessible in the publish environment to community members assigned the role of [community moderator](/help/communities/using/users.md#publishenvironmentusersandgroups) for one or more community sites.

* [Members, Groups](/help/communities/using/members.md)  
  The Members and Groups consoles are for managing community members and member groups that exist in the publish environment from the author environment.

* [Reports](/help/communities/using/reports.md)  
  The Reports console is where reports on assignments, page views, and posted content (UGC) may be generated when a community site has [enabled Adobe Analytics](/help/communities/using/sites-console.md#analytics). The console is only available in the author environment.

* [Resources](/help/communities/using/resources.md)  
  The Resources console is where [enablement managers](/help/communities/using/enablement.md#communitymanagers) create, manage and assign resources to members of an [enablement community site](/help/communities/using/overview.md#enablement-community). The console is only available in the author environment.
