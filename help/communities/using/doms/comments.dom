  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>The comments feature is used to allow signed-in site visitors (members) to share their opinions and knowledge regarding content on the site. This feature is often already present in other features, but may be added to any website.</p> 
  <p>This section of the documentation describes</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>adding <span class="code">Comments </span>to a page</li> 
   <li>configuration settings for the <span class="code">Comments </span>component</li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>Anonymous posting of a comment is not supported. Site visitors must register (become a member) and sign in to participate.</p> 
  </note>
  <h3>Adding Comments to a Page</h3>
  <p>To add a <span class="code">Comments </span>component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span class="code">Communities / Comments</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to comment on, or simply at the bottom of the page.</p> 
  <p>For necessary information, visit <a href="../../communities/using/basics.md">Communities Components Basics</a>.</p> 
  <p>When the <a href="../../communities/using/essentials-comments.md#essentialsforclientside">required client-side libraries</a> are included, this is how the <span class="code">Comments </span>component will appear.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-428.png" />
  <note>

  </note>
  <h3>Configuring Comments</h3>

  <p>Once the custom resource types is known, enter <a href="../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-designmode.md">Design Mode</a> and double click on the placed <span class="code">Comments</span> component to open a dialog with an additional tab.</p>

  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Comment Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">comment </span>component (single comment) in /apps. For example, <span class="code">/apps/social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment</span><br /> This resource will identify the resourceType of the UGC created when a visitor posts a comment.</li> 
   <li><strong>Voting Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">voting </span>component in /apps. For example, <span class="code">/apps/social/components/hbs/voting</span><br /> This resource will identify the resource type of the UGC created when a visitor posts a vote.</li> 
   <li><strong>Comment System Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">comments </span>component (Comment System) in /apps. Leave blank unless the page template <a href="../../communities/using/scf.md#addorincludeacommunitiescomponent">dynamically includes</a> the Comment System in the underlying script instead of being added to the page as a resource (comments node). Learn more by reading about the <a href="../../communities/using/handlebars-helpers.md#include">{{include}} helper</a>.</li> 
  </ul>

  <ul> 
   <li>post a new comment</li> 
   <li>edit their own comment</li> 
   <li>delete their own comment</li> 
   <li>flag others' comments</li> 
  </ul>
