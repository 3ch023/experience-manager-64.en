  <p>The type of features expected from a community experience are well known. Community features are available as community functions. Essentially, they are one or more pages pre-wired to implement a community feature which requires more than simply adding a component to a page in author mode. They are the building blocks used to define the structure of a <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">community site template</a> from which community sites are <a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md">created</a>.</p> 
  <p>Once a community site is created, content may be added to the resulting pages using the standard <a href="../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md">AEM authoring mode</a>.</p> 
  <p>A number of community functions are immediately available as seen in the community functions console. More community functions will be delivered in future releases and custom functions may also be created.</p> 
  <note>
   <p>The consoles for the creation of <a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md">community sites</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">community site templates</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/tools-groups.md">community group templates</a> and <a href="../../communities/using/functions.md">community functions</a> are for use only in the author environment.</p> 
  </note>
  <h2>Community Functions Console</h2>
  <p>In the author environment, to reach the community functions console</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>from global navigation : <strong>Tools, Communities, Community Functions</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-379.png" />
  <h2>Pre-built Functions</h2>
  <p>Following is a brief description of the functions delivered with AEM Communities. Each function is comprised of one or more AEM pages containing Communities components wired together into a feature that is easily incorporated into a <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">community site template</a>.</p> 
  <p>A community site template provides the structure for a community site including login, user profiles, notifications, messaging, site menu, search, theming, and branding features.</p> 
  <h3>Title and URL Settings</h3>
  <p><strong>Title </strong>and <strong>URL </strong>are properties common to all community functions.</p> 
  <p>When a community function is added to a community site template or added when <a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md#modifyingsiteproperties">modifying</a> the structure of a community site, the function's dialog opens so that the Title and URL may be configured.</p> 
  <h4>Configuration Function Details</h4>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-380.png" />
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Title</strong><br /> (<i>required</i>) The text which appears in the menu of features for the site</li> 
   <li><strong>URL</strong><br /> (<i>required</i>) The name used to generate the URI. The name must conform to the <a href="../../sites/developing/using/naming-conventions.md">naming conventions</a> imposed by AEM and JCR.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For example, using the site created from following the <a href="../../communities/using/getting-started.md">Getting Started</a> tutorial, if</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Title = Web Page</li> 
   <li>URL = page</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>then the URL to the page is http://localhost:4503/content/sites/engage/en/<strong>page</strong>.html </p> 
  <p>and the menu link for the page appears as :</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> : the Leaderboard component will need further configuration <i>after</i> a community site is created from a community template which includes the Leaderboard funciton. The Leaderboard component's <a href="../../communities/using/enabling-leaderboard.md#rulestab">rules</a> will need to be specified, which depend on configuration of <a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md">scoring and badges</a> for the community site.</p> 
  <p>When added to a template, the following dialog opens, which specifies the default Title and URL names, as well as default display settings for the template :</p>

  <h2>Create Community Function</h2>
  <p>The ability to create a community function is reached by selecting the <span class="code">Create Community Function</span> icon located at the top of the Community Functions console. Multiple functions based on the same AEM Blueprint may be created and then uniquely customized by opening in author edit mode.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-390.png" />
  <h4>Community Function Name</h4>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-391.png" />
  <p>On the Community Function Name panel, a name, description and whether the function is enabled or disabled are configured :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Community Function Name </strong><br /> the function name used for display and storage</li> 
   <li><strong>Community Function Description </strong><br /> the function description for display</li> 
   <li><strong>Disabled/Enabled </strong><br /> a toggle switch controlling whether the function is referenceable</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>AEM Blueprint</h4>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-392.png" />
  <p>On the <span class="code">AEM Blueprint</span> panel, it is possible to select the blueprint which is the underlying implementation of the community function.</p> 
  <p>The community function is a mini site comprised of one or more pages, pre-wired for inclusion into a community site including login, user profiles, notifications, messaging, site menu, search, theming, and branding features. Once the function is created, it is possible to <a href="#opencommunityfunction">open the function</a> in author edit mode and customize the page and/or component settings.</p> 
  <p>Since the community function is implemented as a <a href="../../sites/administering/using/msm.md#livecopies">live copy</a> of a <a href="../../sites/administering/using/msm-livecopy.md#creatingablueprint">blueprint</a>, it is possible to rollout changes made to a function which affects all community site pages created from the <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">community site template</a> or <a href="../../communities/using/tools-groups.md">community group template</a> that included the function. It is also possible to disassociate a page from its parent blueprint in order to make page-level modifications.</p> 
  <p>See also <a href="../../sites/administering/using/msm.md">Multi Site Manager</a>.</p> 
  <h4>Thumbnail</h4>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-393.png" />
  <p>On the Thumbnail panel, an image may be uploaded to display in the <a href="#communityfunctionsconsole">Community Functions console</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Open Community Function</h2>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-394.png" />
  <p>Select the <span class="code">Open Community Function</span> icon to enter author edit mode for authoring the page content and modifying the configuration of the feature component(s).</p> 
  <h3>Configuring Components</h3>
  <p>A community function is implemented as a Live Copy of an AEM Blueprint, details of which are documented under <a href="../../sites/administering/using/msm.md">Multi Site Manager</a>.</p> 
  <p>It is possible to not only author page content, but to configure components.</p> 
  <p>If configuring a component on a page of a created community site, it may be necessary to cancel <a href="../../sites/administering/using/msm-livecopy.md#changinglivecopycontent">inheritance</a> in order to configure the component. Inheritance should be re-established when configuration is completed.</p> 
  <p>For configuration details, visit <a href="../../communities/using/author-communities.md">Communities Components</a> for authors.</p> 
  <h2>Edit Community Function</h2>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-395.png" />
  <p>Select the <span class="code">Edit Community Function</span> icon to edit the function's properties using the same panels as <a href="#createcommunityfunction">creating a community function</a>, including enabling or disabling the function.</p>
