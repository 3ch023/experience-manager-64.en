  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>The activities of a signed in community member, such as posting to a forum or blog, are collected into a stream which may be filtered and displayed in various ways through configuration of the <span class="code">Activity Streams</span> component. </p> 
  <p>The ability to follow adds another view of activities when community members follow postings of interest or follow the activities of other community members.</p> 
  <p>This section of the documentation describes</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>adding the Activity Streams component to an AEM site</li> 
   <li>configuration settings for Activity Streams component</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Adding Activity Streams to a Page</h3>
  <p>If it is desired to add an <span class="code">Activity Streams</span> component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span class="code">Communities / Activity Streams</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>and drag it into place on a page where activity streams should appear.</p> 
  <p>For necessary information, visit <a href="../../communities/using/basics.md">Communities Components Basics</a>.</p> 
  <p>When the <a href="../../communities/using/essentials-activities.md#essentialsforclientside">required client-side libraries</a> are included, this is how the <span class="code">Activity Streams</span> component will appear :</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-195.png" />
  <h3>Configuring Activity Streams</h3>
  <p>Select the placed <span class="code">Activity Streams</span> component to access and select the <span class="code">Configure</span> icon which opens the edit dialog.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-196.png" />
  <p>Under the <strong>User Activities</strong> tab, specify which activities to display :</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-197.png" />
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Max number of activities</strong><br /> the number of activities to display</li> 
   <li><strong>Stream Resource Path</strong><br /> Leave blank to default to the community site or community group. The stream resource path identifies the source of activities. Default is blank.</li> 
   <li><strong>Display User Activities View</strong><br /> if checked, the activities page will include a tab which filters activities based on those generated within the community by the current member. Default is checked.</li> 
   <li><strong>Display All Activities View</strong><br /> if checked, the activities page will include a tab which includes all activities generated within the community to which the current member has access. Default is checked.</li> 
   <li><strong>Display Following View</strong><br /> if checked, the activities page will include a tab which filters activities based on those the current member is following. Default is checked.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Following View</h3>
  <p>Components must be configured to enable following. Features that allow following are <a href="../../communities/using/blog-feature.md">blog</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/forum.md">forum</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/working-with-qna.md">QnA</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/calendar.md">calendar</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/file-library.md">filelibrary</a>, and <a href="../../communities/using/comments.md">comments</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-198.png" />
  <p>The <strong>Follow </strong>button provides a means to follow entries as activities, <a href="../../communities/using/notifications.md">notifications</a>, and/or <a href="../../communities/using/subscriptions.md">subscriptions</a>. Each time the <strong>Follow </strong>button is selected, it is possible to toggle on or off a selection. The <span class="code">Email Subscriptions</span> selection is only present when configured.</p> 
  <p>If any method of following is selected, the text of the button changes to <strong>Following</strong>. For convenience, it is possible to select <span class="code">Unfollow All</span> to toggle off all methods.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Follow </strong>button will appear </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>when viewing another member's profile</li> 
   <li>on a main feature page, such as forums, QnA, and blogs
    <ul> 
     <li>follows all activity for that general feature</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>for a specific entry, such as a forum topic, QnA question, or blog article
    <ul> 
     <li>follows all activity for that specific entry</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul>
