  <h2>Site Visitor Experience</h2>
  <h3>Creating Idea</h3>
  <p>As with all Communities features, if not signed in, a site visitor may only read ideas and view others opinions (through comments and voting/liking).</p> 
  <p>Once signed in, a member may create a new idea.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-32.png" />
  <p>Before submitting the idea, it is possible for the member to save a draft.</p> 
  <p>By selecting the <span class="code">Save as Draft</span> button, a draft is saved.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-33.png" />
  <p>When viewing saved drafts in the <span class="code">My Drafts</span> tab, select <span class="code">Read More</span> to re-enter edit mode :</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-34.png" />
  <h4>Providing Feedback</h4>
  <p>Once the idea is published, other members can sign in, open the idea (<span class="code">Read More</span>) and like the idea, thus adding to the vote count, and make comments.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-35.png" />
