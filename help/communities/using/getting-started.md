# Getting Started with AEM Communities{#getting-started-with-aem-communities}

For a tutorial on quickly setting up an [enablement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#enablementcommunity), visit [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](../../communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md).
