# Catalog Feature{#catalog-feature}

The [ `Enablement Assignments`](../../communities/using/assignments.md) and `Enablement Catalog` components found in the Communities group in the components browser are components of an [enablement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#enablementcommunity).

The `Enablement Catalog` component allows community members to access a catalog of [enablement resources](../../communities/using/resources.md). The use of AEM tags is an important part of managing the listing of enablement resources in a catalog (see [Tagging Enablement Resources](../../communities/using/tag-resources.md)).

From the [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](../../communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md) tutorial, see a member's view of assignments and catalogs in the [Experience the Published Site](../../communities/using/enablement-published-site.md) section.

### Additional Information {#additional-information}

More information may be found on the [Catalog Essentials](../../communities/using/catalog-developer-essentials.md) page for developers.

The [catalog function](../../communities/using/functions.md#catalogfunction) is available when creating a [community site](../../communities/using/sites-console.md).
