# Developing Communities{#developing-communities}

## Overview {#overview}

AEM Communities simplifies the creation and customizaton of community features such as forums, user groups, blogs, Q&A, calendars, comments, reviews, voting, ratings, and assignments. These features result in user generated content (UGC) being entered in the publish environment.

The foundation of a [community site](/help/communities/overview.md#communitiessites) is the [social component framework](/help/communities/scf.md) (SCF). Creation of a community site begins with the selection of a [community site template](/help/communities/sites-console.md) that is composed of [community functions](/help/communities/functions.md).
