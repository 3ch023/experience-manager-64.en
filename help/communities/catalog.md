# Catalog Feature{#catalog-feature}

The [ `Enablement Assignments`](/help/communities/assignments.md) and `Enablement Catalog` components found in the Communities group in the components browser are components of an [enablement community](/help/communities/overview.md#enablement-community).

The `Enablement Catalog` component allows community members to access a catalog of [enablement resources](/help/communities/resources.md). The use of AEM tags is an important part of managing the listing of enablement resources in a catalog (see [Tagging Enablement Resources](/help/communities/tag-resources.md)).

From the [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](/help/communities/getting-started-enablement.md) tutorial, see a member's view of assignments and catalogs in the [Experience the Published Site](/help/communities/enablement-published-site.md) section.

## Additional Information {#additional-information}

More information may be found on the [Catalog Essentials](/help/communities/catalog-developer-essentials.md) page for developers.

The [catalog function](/help/communities/functions.md#catalog-function) is available when creating a [community site](/help/communities/sites-console.md).
