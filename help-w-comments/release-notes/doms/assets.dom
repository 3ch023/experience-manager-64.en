  <ul> 
   <li>The ability for users to select and later change storage class at will, and define rules for storage of assets from one class to another or manage the lifecycle of their assets.</li>

  <draft-comment lastModifiedBy="arora" lastModifiedDate="2018-04-04T06:10:16.512-0400" type="annotation">
    Can we please check whether Azure &amp; Google cloud are supported? 
  </draft-comment> 
  <h2>Closed User Group</h2> 
  <ul> 
   <li>In AEM 6.4, Closed User Group or CUG provides a way to restrict folder access on publish instance, it’s a touch UI option to add principals through folder properties page at the folder level and are applied to all folder and subfolders/assets inside. </li> 
   <li>In publish mode, if a CUG is configured and authorization enabled om a folder, users are redirected to a login page when they try to access the folder. Therefore, authorized users can access the folder and its assets only after successful login. Hence, CUG restricts read access to a given tree in the content repository for everyone except selected principals.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Dynamic Media add-on</h2> 
  <p>Dynamic Media in 6.4 supports a new mode - where master asset is uploaded and managed with AEM Assets web UI, and dynamic renditions and other dynamic media features are handled in the background by the Dynamic Media cloud delivery service.</p> 
  <p>In this new mode (introduced first with the release of AEM 6.3 Feature Packs 14410 and 18912), users benefit from end-to-end asset management and dynamic media features using the modern AEM Assets web UI, and still leverage the delivery services that are backwards compatible with Dynamic Media Classic (Scene7)—including delivery URLs, which are unchanged.</p> 
  <p>In addition, AEM 6.4 introduces new features powered by Adobe Sensei, enhancements for emerging media like VR and 3D, Dynamic Media viewers, and support for Experience Fragments in Interactive Images and Carousel Banners.</p> 
  <h4>Smart Crop (Powered by Adobe Sensei)</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Smart Crop automatically provides non-destructive cropping of images to preserve the point of interest for responsive design. You can preview cropped suggestions and manually adjust them, if necessary. <br /> </li> 
   <li>This feature also enables automated swatch generation for product imagery. Automated swatch generation helps to add color swatches, pattern swatches, or both to product images automatically.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>See <a href="../assets/using/image-profiles.md" target="_blank">Image Profiles</a> documentation to learn more.</p> 
  <p>See also <a href="../assets/using/adding-dynamic-media-assets-to-pages.md" target="_blank">Adding Dynamic Media Assets to Pages</a> documentation to learn more about using Smart Crop with the Dynamic Media component.</p> 
  <h4>Smart Imaging</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Smart imaging leverages each user's unique viewing characteristics to automatically serve images optimized for their experience, resulting in better pefromance and engagement.</li> 
   <li>Images are automatically converted to different formats based on browser capabilities.</li> 
   <li>Image quality settings are determined in the browser and applied respectively. This intelligence keeps image loading performance acceptable for limited bandwidth and slow connection speeds.</li> 
  </ul>
