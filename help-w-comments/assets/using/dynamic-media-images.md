<p>From Alva: Yes, there is a jira issue about images. I think I had planned to get it done for 6.4. I assigned the issue to you. Basically Cynthia had wanted to create a topic about images - she actually did the outline so it's fairly simple but of course completely up to you if you want to do it.<br /> <br /> I can't remember if I had a page in 6.3. I might've but I think I deleted it. (Can't remember offhand)</p>
