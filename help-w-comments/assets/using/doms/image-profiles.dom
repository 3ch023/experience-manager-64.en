    This is incorrect. It isn't based on pixels per inch. They are straight pixel dimensions. You're subtracting the pixel amounts from all sides. Here is how Image Profiles pixel crop will render. Values are: Top, Bottom, Left, and Right Top left is considered 0,0 and crop is calculated from there. Crop starting point is: Left is X and Top is Y Horizontal is calculated like this: horizontal pixel dimension of original image minus Left and then minus Right. Vertical is calculated like this: vertical pixel height minus Top and then minus Bottom. For example, I have a 4000x3000 image. I use values: Top = 250, Bottom = 500, Left = 300, Right = 700 From top left (300,250) crop using the fill space of (4000-300-700, 3000-250-500 or 3000,2250) You can read how Image Serving handles crop here: https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/s7/is_ir_api/is_api/http_ref/r_crop.html This is crop= and not cropN= RB: updated description

  <h3>Unsharp Mask</h3> 
  <p>You use<strong> Unsharp mask</strong> to fine-tune a sharpening filter effect on the final downsampled image. You can control intensity of effect, radius of the effect (measured in pixels), and a threshold of contrast that will be ignored. This effect uses the same options as Adobe Photoshop’s “Unsharp Mask” filter.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Unsharp mask is only applied to downscaled renditions within the PTIFF (pyramid tiff) that are downsampled more than 50%. That means that the largest-sized renditions within the ptiff are not affected by unsharp mask whereas smaller-sized renditions such as thumbnails are altered (and will show the unsharp mask). </p> 
  </note> 
  <p>In <strong>Unsharp Mask</strong>, you have the following filtering options:</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong>Option</strong></td> 
     <td><strong>Description</strong></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Amount</td> 
     <td>Controls the amount of contrast applied to edge pixels. The default is 1.75. For high-resolution images, you can increase it to as high as 5. Think of Amount as a measure of filter intensity. Range is 0-5.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Radius</td> 
     <td>Determines the number of pixels surrounding the edge pixels that affect the sharpening. For high-resolution images, enter from 1 through 2. A low value sharpens only the edge pixels; a high value sharpens a wider band of pixels. The correct value depends on the size of the image. The default value is 0.2. Range is 0-250.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Threshold</td> 
     <td><p>Determines the range of contrast to ignore when the unsharp mask filter is applied. In other words, this option determines how different the sharpened pixels must be from the surrounding area before they are considered edge pixels and are sharpened. To avoid introducing noise, experiment with values between 0-255.</p> </td>

  <h2>Creating image profiles</h2> 
  <p>To define advanced processing parameters for other asset types, see <a href="../../assets/using/config-dms7.md#configuringassetprocessing">Configuring Asset Processing</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>To create image profiles</strong>:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap or click <strong>Create</strong> to add a new image profile.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Enter a profile name, and values for unsharp mask, crop, or swatch, or both.</p> <p>You may find it helpful to use a profile name that is specific to its intended purpose. For example, if you want to create a profile that generates swatches only--that is, Smart Crop is disable (turned off) and Color and Image Swatch is enabled (turned on)--you could use the profile name "Smart Swatches".</p> <p>See also <a href="#smart-crop-and-smart-swatch-options">Smart Crop and Smart Swatch Options</a> and <a href="#unsharp-mask">Unsharp Mask</a>.</p>  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/crop.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The newly created profile appears in the list of available profiles.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Editing or deleting image profiles</h2> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select the image profile you want to edit or remove. To edit it, select <strong>Edit Image Processing Profile</strong>. To remove it, select <strong>Delete Image Processing Profile</strong>.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-257.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>If editing, save the changes. If deleting, confirm that you want to remove the profile.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Applying an image profile to folders</h2> 
  <p>When you assign an image profile to a folder, any subfolders automatically inherit the profile from its parent folder. This means that you can assign only one image profile to a folder. As such, consider carefully the folder structure of where you upload, store, use, and archive assets.</p> 
  <p>If you assigned a different image profile to a folder, the new profile overrides the previous profile. The previously existing folder assets remain unchanged. The new profile is applied on the assets that are added to the folder later. </p> 
  <p>Folders that have a profile assigned to it are indicated in the user interface by the name of the profile appearing in the card.</p> 
  <p>When you add smart crop to an existing image profile, you need to re-trigger the <a href="../../assets/using/assets-workflow.md" target="_blank">DAM Update Asset workflow</a> if you want to generate crops for existing assets in your asset repository.</p> 
  <draft-comment lastModifiedBy="wyamashi" lastModifiedDate="2018-08-16T19:27:12.315-0400" type="annotation">
    Maybe this should read more like, "When you add smart crop to an existing image profile," As it is written right now, it could be confused with adding an image profile to a new folder. Also, maybe add a link to a Timeline page that describes how to re-trigger a Workflow? 
  </draft-comment> 
  <p>You can apply image profiles to specific folders or globally to all assets. </p> 
  <h3>Applying image profiles to specific folders</h3> 
  <p>You can apply an image profile to a folder from within the <strong>Tools</strong> menu or if you are in the folder, from <strong>Properties</strong>. This section describes how to apply image profiles to folders both ways.</p> 
  <p>Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p> 
  <h4>Applying image profiles to folders from Profiles user interface</h4> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select the image profile that you want to apply to a folder or multiple folders.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-258.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Tap/click <strong>Apply Processing Profile to Folder(s) </strong>and select the folder or multiple folders you want use to receive the newly uploaded assets and tap/click <strong>Apply</strong>. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Applying image profiles to folders from Properties</h4> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Assets </strong>and then to the folder that you want to apply an image profile to.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>On the folder, tap or click the check mark to select it and then tap or click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap the <strong>Image Profiles</strong> tab. From the Profile Name drop-down list, select the profile, then click <strong>Save &amp; Close</strong>. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.</p>

  <h3>Applying an image profile globally</h3> 
  <p>In addition to applying a profile to a folder, you can also apply one globally so that any content uploaded into AEM assets in any folder has the selected profile applied.</p> 
  <p>To apply a profile globally, do one of the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Navigate to <strong>http://&amp;lt;AEM server&amp;gt;/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/assets/foldersharewizard.html/content/dam</strong> and apply the appropriate profile and tap or click <strong>Save</strong>.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-260.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Navigate to CRXDE Lite to the following node: <strong>/content/dam/jcr:content.</strong></p> <p>Add the property<strong> imageProfile:/conf/global/settings/dam/adminui-extension/imageprofile/&amp;lt;name of image profile&amp;gt; </strong>and tap <strong>Save All</strong>. </p>

      We have a bug with Smart crops. If you edit the smart crop and make the area smaller then the output image may show whitespace: https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/CQ-4233847

  <h2>Editing the smart crop or smart swatch of multiple images</h2> 
  <p>After you apply an image profile--containing Smart Crop--to a folder, all images in that folder have a crop applied to them. If desired, you can manually realign or resize the smart crop window in multiple images to further refine their focal point.</p> 
  <p>After you edit a smart crop and save, the change is propagated everywhere you use the crop for the specific images.</p> 
  <p>You can re-run smart crop to generate the additional crops again, if required.</p>

    The way this is written, it sounds like, if I apply an Image Profile that has Smart Crop to a Folder, all Image Assets in that Folder are reprocessed to include Smart Crop. Is that correct?

  <h2>Removing an image profile from folders</h2> 
  <p>When you remove an image profile from a folder, any subfolders automatically inherit the removal of the profile from its parent folder. However, any processing of files that has occurred within the folders remains intact.</p> 
  <p>You can remove an image profile from a folder from within the <strong>Tools</strong> menu or if you are in the folder, from <strong>Properties</strong>. This section describes how to remove image profiles from folders both ways.</p> 
  <h4>Removing image profiles from folders via Profiles user interface</h4> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Image Profiles.</strong></p> </li> 
   <li><p>Select the image profile that you want to remove from a folder or multiple folders.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Tap <strong>Remove Processing Profile from Folder(s) </strong>and select the folder or multiple folders you want use to remove the profile from and tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p> <p>You can confirm that the image profile is no longer applied to a folder because the name no longer appears below the folder name. </p>
