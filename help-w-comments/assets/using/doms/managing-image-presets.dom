  <p>Image Presets enable AEM Assets to dynamically deliver images at different sizes, in different formats, or with other image properties that are generated dynamically. Each Image Preset represents a predefined collection of sizing and formatting commands for displaying images. When you create an Image Preset, you choose a size for image delivery. You also choose formatting commands so that the appearance of the image is optimized when the image is delivered for viewing.</p> 
  <p>Administrators can create presets for exporting assets. Users can choose a preset when they export images, which also reformats images to the specifications that the administrator specifies. </p> 
  <p>You can also create image presets that are responsive. If you apply a responsive image preset to your assets, they change depending on the device or screensize they are viewed on. You can configure image presets to use CMYK in the color space in addition to RGB or Gray. </p> 
  <p>This section describes how to create, modify, and generally manage image presets. You can apply an image preset to an image anytime you preview it. See <a href="../../assets/using/image-presets.md">Applying Image Presets</a>.</p>

  <note> 
   <p>Smart imaging works with your existing image presets and uses intelligence at the last millisecond of delivery to further reduce image file size based on browser or network connection speed. See <a href="../../assets/using/imaging-faq.md">Smart Imaging</a> for more information.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Understanding Image Presets</h3> 
  <p>Like a macro, an Image Preset is a predefined collection of sizing and formatting commands saved under a name. To understand how Image Presets work, suppose your web site requires each product image to appear in different sizes, different formats, and compression rates for desktop and mobile delivery.</p> 
  <p>You could create two image presets: one with 500 x 500 pixels for desktop version and 150 x 150 pixels for the mobile version. You create two Image Presets, one called <strong>Enlarge</strong> to display images at 500x500 pixels and one called <strong>Thumbnail</strong> to display images at 150 x 150 pixels. To deliver images at the <strong>Enlarge</strong> and <strong>Thumbnail</strong> size, AEM looks up the definition of the Enlarge Image Preset and Thumbnail Image Preset. Then AEM dynamically generates an image at the size and formatting specifications of each Image Preset.</p> 
  <p>Images that are reduced in size when they are delivered dynamically can lose sharpness and detail. For this reason, each Image Preset contains formatting controls for optimizing an image when it is delivered at a particular size. These controls make sure that your images are sharp and clear when they are delivered to your web site or application.</p> 
  <p>Administrators can create Image Presets. To create an image preset, you can start from scratch or you can start from an existing one and save it under a new name.</p> 
  <h3>Managing Image Presets</h3> 
  <p>You manage your image presets in AEM by tapping or clicking the AEM logo to access the global navigation console and then tapping or clicking the Tools icon and navigating to <strong>Assets </strong>&amp;gt;<strong> Image Presets</strong>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-517.png" /> 
  <note> 
   <p>Any image presets you create are also available as dynamic renditions when you preview or deliver assets.</p> 
   <p>In <em>Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode</em>, you do <strong>not</strong> need to publish image presets as image presets are automatically published.</p> 
   <p>In <em>Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode</em>, you need to manually publish image presets.</p> 
   <p>See <a href="#publishingimagepresets">Publishing Image Presets.</a></p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p>The system shows a variety of renditions when you select <strong>Renditions</strong> in an asset's Detail View. You can increase or decrease the number of image presets that display. See <a href="#increasingthenumberofimagepresetsthatdisplay">Increasing the number of image presets that display</a>.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Adobe Illustrator (AI), Postscript (EPS), and PDF file formats</h3> 
  <p>If you intend to support the ingestion of AI, EPS, and PDF files so that you can generate dynamic renditions of these file formats, you may want to review the following information before you create image presets.</p> 
  <draft-comment lastModifiedBy="rbrough" lastModifiedDate="2019-01-15T15:25:47.724-0500" type="annotation">
    This whole section on AI, ESP, and PDFs should probably be its own page and only referenced on this page to go to that page. It is only necessary, if the customer plans to use those files. I have not tested this before so I do not know how accurate this section is. For the most part, I skipped over it, since I don't know what to expect. RB: Not fixed. 
  </draft-comment> 
  <p>Adobe Illustrator's file format is a variant of PDF. The main differences, in the context of AEM Assets, is the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Adobe Illustrator documents consist of a single page with multiple layers. Each layer is extracted as a PNG sub-asset under the main Illustrator asset.</li> 
   <li>PDF documents consist of one or more pages. Each page is extracted as a single page PDF sub-asset under the main multi-page PDF document.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The sub-assets are created by the <span class="code">Create Sub Asset process</span> component within the overall <span class="code">DAM Update Asset</span> workflow. To see this process component within the workflow, tap <strong>Tools </strong>&amp;gt; <strong>Workflow</strong> &amp;gt; <strong>Models</strong> &amp;gt; <strong>DAM Update Asset</strong> &amp;gt; <strong>Edit</strong>.</p> 
  <p>See also <a href="../../assets/using/managing-linked-subassets.md#viewingpagesofamultipagefile">Viewing pages of a multi-page file</a>.<br /> <br /> You can view the sub-assets or the pages when you open the asset, tap the Content menu, and select <strong>Subassets</strong> or <strong>Pages</strong>. The sub-assets are real assets. That is, PDF pages are extracted by the <span class="code">Create Sub Asset</span> workflow component. They are then stored as <span class="code">page1.pdf</span>, <span class="code">page2.pdf</span>, and so on below the main asset. After they are stored, the <span class="code">DAM Update Asset</span> workflow processes them.<br /> <br /> To use Dynamic Media to preview and generate dynamic renditions for AI, EPS or PDF files, the following processing steps are required:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>In the <span class="code">DAM Update Asset</span> workflow, the <span class="code">Rasterize PDF/AI Image Preview Rendition</span> process component rasterizes the first page of the original asset--using the configured resolution--into a <span class="code">cqdam.preview.png</span> rendition.</li> 
   <li>The <span class="code">cqdam.preview.png</span> rendition is then optimized into a PTIFF by the <span class="code">Dynamic Media Process Image Assets</span> process component within the workflow.</li> 
  </ol>

    When I tried the AI and PDF files, they did not result in what is noted here, it is because I did not see any subassets or page options UI. To me, it looks like the file is flattened and not ripped apart into individual images. RB: Not fixed. It's not clear to me if this annotation is describing a bug or it really is supposed to work that way so not fixing.

  </draft-comment> 
  <p>Using the default process arguments, the first page of a PDF/AI document is rasterized at 72 ppi and the generated preview image is sized at 2048 x 2048 pixels. For a typical deployment, you may want to increase the resolution to a minimum of 150 ppi or more. For example, a US letter size document at 300 ppi requires a maximum width and height of 2550 x 3300 pixels, respectively.<br /> <br /> Max Width and Max Height limit the resolution at which to rasterize. For example, if the maximums are unchanged, and Resolution is set to 300 ppi, a US Letter document is rasterized at 186 ppi. That is, the document is 1581 x 2046 pixels.<br /> <br /> The <span class="code">Rasterize PDF/AI Image Preview Rendition</span> process component has a maximum defined to ensure that it does not create overly large images in memory. Such large images can overflow the memory provided to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Care must be taken to provide the JVM with enough memory to manage the configured number of parallel workflows, with each having the potential to create an image at the maximum configured size.</p> 
  <h3>InDesign (INDD) file format</h3> 
  <p>If you intend to support the ingestion of INDD files so that you can generate dynamic rendition of this file format, you may want to review the following information before you create image presets.</p> 
  <p>For InDesign files, sub assets are extracted only if the Adobe InDesign server is integrated with AEM. Referenced assets are linked based on their metadata. InDesign Server is not required for linking. However, the referenced assets must be present within AEM before the InDesign files are processed for the links to be created between the InDesign files and the referenced assets.</p> 
  <p>See <a href="../../assets/using/indesign.md">Integrating AEM Assets with InDesign Server</a>.<br /> <br /> The Media Extraction process component in the <span class="code">DAM Update Asset</span> workflow runs several preconfigured Extend Scripts to process InDesign files.</p> 
  <draft-comment lastModifiedBy="rbrough" lastModifiedDate="2019-01-15T15:37:25.638-0500" type="annotation">
    Like the section regarding AI, EPS, and PDFs, this should be on a separate page and only referenced in case the user needs to do anything. Also, from what I was told by a developer, INDD is not supported natively; it requires connecting to an external server. Like above, I don't know what is expected if a user tries uploading an INDD to either DMS7 or DM Hybrid. RB: It will be left here to keep the information from becoming too fragmented. A user can easily skip it if they want. I suspect this is used very little if at all. There have never been any support tickets come through about it.

   </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <h3>Configuring Image Thumbnail Size</h3> 
  <p>You can configure the size of thumbnails by configuring those settings in the <strong>DAM Update Asset </strong>workflow. There are two steps in the workflow where you can configure the thumbnail size of image assets. Although one (<strong>Dynamic Media Process Image Assets</strong>) is used for dynamic image assets and the other (<strong>Process Thumbnails</strong>) for static thumbnail generation or when all other processes fail to generate thumbnails, <em>both</em> should have the same settings.</p> 
  <p>With the <strong>Dynamic Media Process Image Assets</strong> step, thumbnails are generated by the image server, and this configuration is independent of the configuration applied to the <strong>Process Thumbnails</strong> step. Generating thumbnails through the <strong>Process Thumbnails</strong> step is the slowest and most memory intensive way to create thumbnails. </p> 
  <p>Thumbnail sizing is defined in the following format: <strong>width:height:center</strong>, for example <em>80:80:false</em>. The width and height determine the size in pixels of the thumbnail; the center value is either false or true and if set to true, it indicates that the thumbnail image has exactly the size given in the configuration. If the resized image is smaller, it will be centered within the thumbnail. </p>

  <note> 
   <p>In order to see the <strong>URL</strong> and <strong>RESS</strong> buttons when applying an image preset to an asset, the asset must be published.</p> 
   <p>In Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode, image presets and image assets are automatically published.</p> 
   <p>In Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode, you must manually publish image presets and image assets.</p>

  <h3>Image Preset Options</h3> 
  <p>When you create or edit image presets, you have the options described in this section. In addition, Adobe recommends these “best practice” option choices to start:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Format</strong> (<strong>Basic</strong> tab) - Select <strong>JPEG</strong> or another format that meets your requirements. All web browsers support the JPEG image format; it offers a good balance between small files sizes and image quality. However, JPEG format images use a lossy compression scheme that can introduce unwanted image artifacts if the compression setting is too low. For that reason, Adobe recommends setting the compression quality to 75. This setting offers a good balance between image quality and small file size.</li> 
   <li><strong>Enable Simple Sharpening</strong> - Do not select <strong>Enable Simple</strong> <strong>Sharpening</strong> (this sharpening filter offers less control than Unsharp Masking settings).</li> 
   <li><strong>Sharpening: Resampling Mode</strong> - Select <strong>Bi-Cubic</strong>.</li> 
  </ul>

     <td><strong>Format</strong></td> 
     <td><p>Choose a format from the menu.</p> <p>Choosing <strong>JPEG</strong> offers the following additional options:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><strong>Quality</strong> - Controls the JPEG compression level. This setting affects both file size and image quality. The JPEG quality scale is 1-100. Scale is visible when you drag the slider.</li> 
       <li><strong>Enable JPG Chrominance Downsampling</strong> - Because the eye is less sensitive to high-frequency color information than high-frequency luminance, JPEG images divide image information into luminance and color components. When a JPEG image is compressed, the luminance component is left at full resolution, while the color components are downsampled by averaging together groups of pixels. Downsampling reduces the data volume by one half or one third with almost no impact on perceived quality. Downsampling is not applicable to grayscale images. This technique reduces the amount of compression useful for images with high contrast (for example, images with overlaid text).</li>

      </ul> <p>In <strong>Unsharp Mask</strong>, you have the following options:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><strong>Amount</strong> - Controls the amount of contrast applied to edge pixels. The default real number value is 1.0. For high-resolution images, you can increase it to as high as 5.0. Think of Amount as a measure of filter intensity.</li> 
       <li><strong>Radius</strong> - Determines the number of pixels surrounding the edge pixels that affect the sharpening. For high-resolution images, enter a real number from 1 through 2. A low value sharpens only the edge pixels; a high value sharpens a wider band of pixels. The correct value depends on the size of the image.</li> 
       <li><strong>Threshold</strong> - Determines the range of contrast to ignore when the unsharp mask filter is applied. In other words, this option determines how different the sharpened pixels must be from the surrounding area before they are considered edge pixels and are sharpened. To avoid introducing noise, experiment with integer values between 2 and 20. </li> 
       <li><strong>Apply to</strong> - Determines whether the unsharpening applies to each color or brightness.</li>

  <h3>Defining Image Preset Options with Image Modifiers</h3> 
  <p>In addition to the options available in the Basic and Advanced tabs, you can define image modifiers to give you more options when defining image presets. Image Rendering relies on the Scene7 image rendering API and are defined in detail in the <a href="http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/s7/is_ir_api/is_api/http_ref/c_http_protocol_reference.html">HTTP Protocol Reference</a>.</p>
