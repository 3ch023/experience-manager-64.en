# Applying Viewer Presets{#applying-viewer-presets}

A Viewer Preset is a collection of settings that determine how users view rich-media assets on their computer screens and mobile devices. You can apply any viewer presets created by your administrator to an asset.

If you are an administrator and need to manage, create, sort, and delete viewer presets, see [Managing Viewer Presets](../../assets/using/managing-viewer-presets.md).

>See also [Publishing Viewer Presets](../../assets/using/managing-viewer-presets.md#publishingviewerpresets).

>You may not need to publish viewer presets depending on what publish mode you are using.

>Any problems with viewer presets, see [Troubleshooting Dynamic Media - Scene7](../../assets/using/troubleshoot-dms7.md#viewers).

   This second sentence does not quite make sense. When choosing a Viewer Preset, a separate popup window does not display. the Viewer should load to the right of the left rail. RB: Fixed.
