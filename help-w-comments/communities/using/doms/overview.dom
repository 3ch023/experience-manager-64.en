  <p>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Communities provides the ability to quickly create an on-premise community site that has improved performance, improved site management, and encourages the conversion of site visitors to valuable community members.</p> 
  <p>Contact your account representative for information regarding licensing of AEM Communities as well as additional licensing for enablement features and Adobe Analytics.</p> 
  <h2>Communities Features</h2>
  <p>AEM Communities enables the development of a relationship with site visitors that informs through blogs, Q&amp;A, and event calendars, while gaining insights through forums, comments, and other community content, often referred to as user generated content (UGC).</p> 
  <p>Further, AEM Communities allows moderation by trusted members in the publish environment, social login with Twitter and Facebook, inline translation of community content, creation of community groups from the published community site, scoring to award badges, file sharing, notifications and activity streams.</p> 
  <p>Communities features can be demonstrated using the <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-demo-machine/wiki">AEM Demo Machine</a> available publicly on GitHub.com or with the new We.Retail reference implementation.</p> 
  <h2>Community Sites</h2>
  <p>A community site is an AEM Site created using a simple wizard that results in a website with many common features pre-wired into the site. </p> 
  <p>The <a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md">site creation wizard</a> :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>assembles features of the site, based on the selected <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">community site template</a> which is 
    <ul> 
     <li>built from <a href="#communityfunctions">community functions</a></li> 
     <li>optional <a href="#communitygroups">community groups</a> feature</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>uses settings to configure :
    <ul> 
     <li>moderation</li> 
     <li>login</li> 
     <li>translation</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>provides essential features :
    <ul> 
     <li>responsive design :<br /> uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap themes</a></li> 
     <li>login :<br /> self-registration, <a href="../../communities/using/social-login.md">social login</a>, user profiles</li> 
     <li>notifications :<br /> members see events of relevance to them</li> 
     <li>messaging :<br /> members may send or receive messages within the community site</li> 
     <li>search :<br /> ability to search within the community site</li> 
     <li>language switching :<br /> ability to select a language for a <a href="../../sites/administering/using/translation.md">multillingual site</a></li> 
     <li>administration :<br /> access for authorized members to moderate and manage users within the community site</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>eliminates many page-level authoring steps :
    <ul> 
     <li>branding :<br /> optional upload of a banner image for display on all pages of the community site</li> 
     <li>navigation menu :<br /> navigation links are provided for the features included in the community site template</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul>

  <h2>Community Content Persistence</h2>
  <p>To improve the performance and synchronization of community content, AEM Communities requires a common store specifically for user generated content (UGC) shared between all AEM (author and publish) instances. </p> 
  <p>Community content is easily accessed through the storage resource provider (SRP), which provides a layer to separate access from the underlying topology and supports a common store for UGC.</p> 
  <p>To learn more about community content persistence and recommended deployments visit :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/working-with-srp.md">Community Content Storage</a> : discusses the available SRP storage options for UGC</li> 
   <br /> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/topologies.md">Recommended Topologies</a> : discusses topologies based on use case and SRP choice</li> 
   <br /> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/upgrade.md">Upgrading to AEM 6.3 Communities</a> : provides useful information regarding UGC when moving to AEM 6.3.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Communities Consoles</h2>
  <p>In the author environment, the global navigation console provides access to the <a href="../../communities/using/consoles.md">Communities console</a>, which contains :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md">Sites</a> console

    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Community Site Templates</h2>
  <p>Community site creation is based on selection of a community site template to quickly setup a community site that is independent of any sample site. </p> 
  <p>A community site template, composed of community functions and community group templates, provides the structure for a community site including login, user profiles, messaging, site menu, search, theming, and branding features.</p> 
  <p>See the <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">Site Templates console</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Community Functions</h2>
  <p>The features expected of a community experience are well known. With AEM Communities, these features are available as building blocks, known as community functions. </p> 
  <p>Community functions are normal AEM pages comprised of components wired together into a feature that is easily incorporated into a sommunity site template.</p> 
  <p>See the <a href="../../communities/using/functions.md">Community Functions console</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Community Groups and Group Templates</h2>
  <p>The community groups feature is the ability for a sub-community to be dynamically created within a community site by authorized users and community members from both the author and publish environments .</p> 
  <p>From the author environment, community groups (sub-communities) may be created within an existing community site or nested within an existing group, when the structure of the template contains the <a href="../../communities/using/functions.md#groupsfunction">Groups function</a>.</p> 
  <p>Creating a community group requires the selection of a community group template that provides the design of the community group page(s). When a Groups function is added to a template structure, it is configured to either specify one group template or to provide a choice of templates at the time a new community group is created.</p>

  </ul> 
  <h2>Community Components</h2>
  <p>The <a href="../../communities/using/author-communities.md">community components</a> from which a community site is built may be used to add Communities features to any AEM Site.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="../../communities/using/components-guide.md">community components guide</a> is available for interactive exploration of the components.</p> 
  <h2>Types of Communities</h2>
  <h3>Engagement Community</h3>
  <p>An engagement community is a community site focused on engaging customers to inform, solicit feedback, and allow customers to interact as community members.</p> 
  <p>Features of an engagement community may include :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>login</li> 
   <li>messaging</li> 
   <li>forums</li> 
   <li>comments</li>
