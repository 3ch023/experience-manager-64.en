  <p>For AEM Communities, moderation may be performed by administrators and trusted community members directly on the published page where the community content was posted.</p> 
  <p>When using a <a href="../../communities/using/moderation.md">moderation console</a>, the information displayed for the content includes a link to the published page to allow access to additional moderation actions available when moderating in-context.</p> 
  <h2>Moderation Actions</h2>
  <p>Visit the moderation overview for a description of <a href="../../communities/using/moderate-ugc.md#moderationactions">moderation actions</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Moderation UI</h2>
  <p>The UI presented to the moderator on the publish instance is contained within the dialog for posting and managing user generated content (UGC). The elements of the UI are determined by the status of the site visitor - whether they are...</p> 
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">#1 - the member who posted the content<br /> #2 - a trusted member moderator<br /> #3 - an administrator<br /> #4 - signed in, but neither an administrator, moderator, nor author of the content<br /> #5 - not signed in</p> 
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Using the <a href="http://localhost:4503/content/sites/engage/en.html">Geometrixx Engage</a> site created when <a href="../../communities/using/getting-started.md">Getting Started with AEM Communities</a>, it is possible to quickly setup a thread in a forum on which to experience various moderation activites in the publish environment, as seen below.</p> 
  <p>Aaron McDonald (aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com) was identified as a a trusted community member by adding him to the community-engage-moderators group when creating the site.</p> 
  <p>Rebekah Larsen (rebekah.larsen@trashymail.com) can be added as a member of community-engage-members group using the <a href="../../communities/using/members.md">Members console</a>.</p>
