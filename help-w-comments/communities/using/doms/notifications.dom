  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>AEM Communities provides a notifications section which displays events of interest to the signed in community member.</p> 
  <p>Notifications are similar to <a href="../../communities/using/essentials-activities.md">activities</a> and <a href="../../communities/using/subscriptions.md">subscriptions</a> as they may result from</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>the member posting content</li> 
   <li>the member choosing to follow another member</li> 
   <li>the member choosing to follow specific topics, articles and other threads of content</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>What distinguishes notifications from activities and subscriptions is</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>a link to the notifications section is always present in a community site's header
    <ul> 
     <li>activities require the <a href="../../communities/using/functions.md#activitystreamfunction">activity stream function</a> to be included in the community site's structure</li> 
     <li>subscriptions require <a href="../../communities/using/email.md">configuration of email</a></li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>the implementation of notifications is through scalable and pluggable channels
    <ul> 
     <li>activities are only available on the web</li> 
     <li>subscriptions are only available using email</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>As of Communities <a href="../../communities/using/deploy-communities.md#latestfeaturepack">FP1</a>, the notification channels available are</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>the web channel, accessed using the <span class="code">Notifications</span> link</li> 
   <li>the email channel, available when email is properly configured</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Future channels are mobile and desktop.</p> 
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p><strong>Configure Email</strong></p> 
  <p>Email must be configured in order for the email channel for notifications to be functional.</p> 
  <p>For instructions on setting up email, see <a href="../../communities/using/analytics.md">Configuring Email</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Enable Follow</strong></p> 
  <p>Components must be configured to enable following. Features that allow following are <a href="../../communities/using/blog-feature.md">blog</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/forum.md">forum</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/working-with-qna.md">QnA</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/calendar.md">calendar</a>, <a href="../../communities/using/file-library.md">filelibrary</a>, and <a href="../../communities/using/comments.md">comments</a>.</p> 
  <p>Note that</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>components used within community <a href="../../communities/using/sites.md">site templates</a> and <a href="../../communities/using/tools-groups.md">group templates</a> may already be configured to allow following</li> 
   <li>member profiles are already configured to allow other memebers to follow</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Notifications from Following</h2>
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-262.png" />
  <p>The <strong>Follow </strong>button provides a means to follow entries as activities, subscriptions and/or notifications. Each time the <strong>Follow </strong>button is selected, it is possible to toggle on or off a selection. The <span class="code">Email Subscriptions</span> selection is only present when configured.</p> 
  <p>If any method of following is selected, the text of the button changes to <strong>Following</strong>. For convenience, it is possible to select <span class="code">Unfollow All</span> to toggle off all methods.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Follow </strong>button will appear </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>when viewing another member's profile</li> 
   <li>on a main feature page, such as forums, QnA, and blogs
    <ul> 
     <li>follows all activity for that general feature</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>for a specific entry, such as a forum topic, QnA question, or blog article
    <ul> 
     <li>follows all activity for that specific entry</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Managing Notification Settings</h2>
  <p>By selecting the Notification Settings link from the Notifications page, it is possible for each member to manage how notifications are received.</p> 
  <p>The web channel is always enabled.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-263.png" />
  <p>The email channel, which relies on proper <a href="../../communities/using/email.md">configuration of email</a>, provides the same settings as for the web channel.</p> 
  <p>The email channel is off by default.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-264.png" />
  <p>It may be turned on by a member, but still depends on email being configured.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-265.png" />
  <h2>Viewing Notifications</h2>
  <h3>Web Notifications</h3>
  <p>A <a href="../../communities/using/sites-console.md">wizard created community site</a> now includes a link to the <span class="code">Notifications</span> feature in the site's header bar above the banner. Unlike messages, notifications are created for every community site, while messages must be enabled during the site creation process.</p> 
  <p>When visiting the published site, selecting the <span class="code">Notifications</span> link will display all notifications for the member.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-266.png" />
  <h3>Email Notifications</h3>
  <p>When the email channel is enabled, the member receives an email which contains a link to the content on the web.</p>
