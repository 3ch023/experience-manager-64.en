  <p>For necessary information, visit <a href="../../communities/using/basics.md">Communities Components Basics</a>.</p> 
  <p>When the <a href="../../communities/using/reviews-basics.md#essentialsforclientside">required client-side libraries</a> are included, this is how the <span class="code">Reviews </span>component will appear.</p>

  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-360.png" />

  <h3>Changing to a Custom Review Type</h3>
  <p>The Reviews component uses the Comment System.</p> 
  <p>By changing the Comment Resource Type, the comment system will no longer generate an instance of a comment using the default, but rather one that has been customized (extended) by developers.</p> 
  <p>Once the custom resource types is known, enter <a href="../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-designmode.md">Design Mode</a> and double click on the placed <span class="code">Comments</span> component to open a dialog with an additional tab.</p> 
  <p>Under the <strong>Resource Types </strong>tab, specify the custom resourceType for new instances of the <span class="code">Comments or Voting </span>components :</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-362.png" />
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Comment Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">comment </span>component (single comment) in /apps. For example, <span class="code">/apps/social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment</span><br /> This resource will identify the resourceType of the UGC created when a visitor posts a comment.</li> 
   <li><strong>Voting Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">voting </span>component in /apps. For example, <span class="code">/apps/social/components/hbs/voting</span><br /> This resource will identify the resource type of the UGC created when a visitor posts a vote.</li> 
   <li><strong>Comment System Resource Type</strong><br /> Navigate to the resourceType of an extended <span class="code">comments </span>component (Comment System) in /apps. Leave blank unless the page template <a href="../../communities/using/scf.md#addorincludeacommunitiescomponent">dynamically includes</a> the Comment System in the underlying script instead of being added to the page as a resource (comments node). Learn more by reading about the <a href="../../communities/using/handlebars-helpers.md#include">{{include}} helper</a></li> 
  </ul>
