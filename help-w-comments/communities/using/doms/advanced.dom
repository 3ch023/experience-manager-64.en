  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Advanced scoring allows awarding of badges to identify members as experts. Advanced scoring assigns points based on the quantity <i>and </i>quality of content created by a member, whereas basic scoring assigns points simply based on the quantity of content created.</p> 
  <p>This difference is due to the scoring engine used to calculate the scores. The basic scoring engine applies simple math. The advanced scoring engine is an adaptive algorithm that rewards active members who contribute valued and relevant content, deduced through natural language processing (NLP) of a topic.</p> 
  <p>In addition to content relevance, the scoring algorithms take into account member activities, such as voting and percentage of answers. While basic scoring includes them quantitatively, advanced scoring uses them algorithmically.</p> 
  <p>Therefore, the advanced scoring engine requires enough data to make analysis meaningful. The achievement threshold for becoming an expert is constantly re-evaluated as the algorithm continually adjusts to the volume and quality of content created. There is also a concept of <i>decay </i>of a member's older posts. If an expert member stops participating in the subject matter where they gained expert status, at some pre-determined point (see <a href="#configurablescoringengine">scoring engine configuration</a>) they could lose their status as an expert. </p> 
  <p>Setting up advanced scoring is virtually the same as basic scoring :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>basic and advanced scoring and badging rules are <a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md#applyrulestocontent">applied to content</a> in the same manner
    <ul> 
     <li>basic and advanced scoring and badging rules may be applied to the same content</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md#enablebadgesforcomponent">enabling badges for components</a> is generic</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The differences in setting up the scoring and badging rules are :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>configurable advanced scoring engine</li> 
   <li>advanced scoring rules :
    <ul> 
     <li>scoringType set to 'advanced'</li> 
     <li>requires stopwords</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>advanced badging rules :
    <ul> 
     <li>badgingType set to 'advanced'</li> 
     <li>badgingLevels set to number of expert levels to award</li> 
     <li>requires badgingPaths array of badges instead of thresholds array mapping points to badges</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>To use advanced scoring and badging capabilities, install the <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq640/social/cq-social-expert-identification-pkg" target="_blank">Expert Identification package</a>.</p> 
  </note>
  <h2>Configurable Scoring Engine</h2>
  <p>The advanced scoring engine provides an OSGi configuration with parameters that affect the advanced scoring algorithm. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-268.png" />
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>scoring weights</strong><br /> For a topic, specify the verb that should be given the highest priority when calculating the score. One or more topics may be entered, but limited to <strong>one verb per topic</strong>. See <a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md#topicsandverbs">Topics and Verbs</a>.<br /> Entered as <span class="code">topic,verb</span> with the comma escaped. For example :<br /> <span class="code">/social/forum/hbs/social/forum\,ADD</span><br /> Default is set to the ADD verb for QnA and forum components.</li> 
   <li><strong>scoring range</strong><br /> The range for advanced scores is defined by this value (maximum possible score) and 0 (lowest possible score.<br /> Default value is 100 so that scoring range is 0-100.</li> 
   <li><strong>entity decay time interval</strong><br /> This parameter represents the number of hours after which all entity scores are decayed. This is required to no longer include old content in scores for a community site.<br /> Default value is 216000 hours (~24 years).</li> 
   <li><strong>scoring growth rate</strong><br /> This specifies the score. between 0 and scoring range, beyond which growth slows to limit the number of experts.<br /> Default value is 50.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Advanced Scoring Rules</h2>
  <p>In basic scoring, the quantity needed to earn a badge is known.</p> 
  <p>In advanced scoring, the quantity needed is constantly adjusting based on the amount of quality data within the system. The scoring is continually calculated in a manner similar to a bell curve.</p> 
  <p>If a member earned an expert badge on a topic which is no longer active, there is a possiblity they will lose their badge due to decay over time.</p> 
  <h3>scoringType</h3>
  <p>A scoring rule is a set of scoring sub-rules, each of which declares the <span class="code">scoringType</span>.</p> 
  <p>To invoke the advanced scoring engine, the <span class="code">scoringType </span>should be set to <span class="code">advanced</span>.</p> 
  <p>See <a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md#scoringsubrules">Scoring Sub-Rules</a>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-269.png" />
  <h3>stopwords</h3>
  <p>The advanced scoring package installs a configuration folder that contains a stopwords file :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>/etc/community/scoring/configuration/stopwords</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The advanced scoring algorithm uses the list of words contained in the stopwords file to identify common English words that are ignored during content processing.</p> 
  <p>There is no expectation that this file would be modified.</p> 
  <p>If the stopwords file is missing, the advanced scoring engine will throw an error.</p> 
  <h2>Advanced Badging Rules</h2>
  <p>The advanced badging rule properties differ from the <a href="../../communities/using/implementing-scoring.md#badgingrules">basic badging rule properties</a>.</p> 
  <p>Instead of associating points with a badge image, it is only necessary to identify the number of experts allowed and the badge image to award.</p>

     <td style="text-align: left;"><i>(required)</i> A multi-value string of badge images up to the number of badgingLevels. The badge image paths must be ordered so the first is awarded to the highest expert.
