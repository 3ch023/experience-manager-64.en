  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>AEM Communities features often require site visitors to be registered and signed-in before participating in a community in the publish environment. Their user registration need only exist in the publish environment and they are commonly referred to as <i>members</i> to distinguish them from <i>users</i> registered in the author environment.</p> 
  <h4>Members (Users) on Publish</h4>
  <p>Using the Communities Members and Groups consoles, members and member groups registered in the <i>publish</i> environment may be created and managed from the <i>author</i> environment. This is only possible when the <a href="../../communities/using/deploy-communities.md#tunnelserviceonauthor">tunnel service</a> is enabled. </p> 
  <h4>Users on Author</h4>
  <p>For managing users and groups registered in the <i>author</i> environment, is is necessary to use the platform's security console :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>from global navigation select <span class="code">Tools, Security, Users</span></li> 
   <li>from global navigation select <span class="code">Tools, Security, Groups</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <note>
   <p>With sample content deployed and enabled, many sample users exist in both the author and publish environments. These users will not be present when running with <a href="../../sites/administering/using/production-ready.md">nosamplecontent runmode</a>.</p> 
  </note>
  <h2>Members Console</h2>
  <p>In the author environment, to reach the Members console for managing members registered in the publish environment :</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>from global navigation : <strong>Navigation, Communities, Members</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>It will not be possible to use the Members console if the <a href="../../communities/using/deploy-communities.md#tunnelserviceonauthor">tunnel service</a> is not enabled.</p>
