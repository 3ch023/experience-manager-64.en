  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The calendar feature supports providing community event information in a calendar format either to all site visitors or only signed in site visitors (community members), while only authorized members may add events.</p> 
  <p>This section of the documentation describes</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>adding the calendar feature to an AEM site</li> 
   <li>configuration settings for <span class="code">Calendar </span>components</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Adding a Calendar to a Page</h2>
  <p>To add a <span class="code">Calendar</span> component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span class="code">Communities / Calendar</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to review.</p> 
  <p>For necessary information, visit <a href="../../communities/using/basics.md">Communities Components Basics</a>.</p> 
  <p>When the <a href="../../communities/using/calendar-basics-for-developers.md#essentialsforclientside">required client-side libraries</a> are included, this is how the <span class="code">Calendar</span> component will appear.</p>
