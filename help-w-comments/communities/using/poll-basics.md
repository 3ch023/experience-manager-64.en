# Poll Essentials{#poll-essentials}

The poll component is a subclass of [tally](../../communities/using/tally.md).

While the tally class, along with the [rating](../../communities/using/rating-basics.md) and [voting](../../communities/using/essentials-voting.md) subclasses, has been ported to the [social component framework](../../communities/using/scf.md) as HBS components, the poll feature has not yet been ported.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The poll feature is not currently available. It will be re-introduced in a future release.
