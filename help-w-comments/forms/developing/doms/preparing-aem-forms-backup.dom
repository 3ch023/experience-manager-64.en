  <h2 id="about_the_backup_and_restore_service">About the Backup and Restore Service</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Backup and Restore service lets you put AEM Forms into <i>backup mode</i>, which enables hot backups to be performed. The Backup and Restore service does not actually perform a backup of AEM Forms or restore your system. Instead, it puts your server in a state for consistent and reliable backups while allowing your server to continue to run. You are responsible for the actions to back up the Global Document Storage (GDS) and the database connected to the forms server. The GDS is a directory used to store files used within a long-lived process. </p>
  <p>Backup mode is a state that the server enters so that files in the GDS are not being purged while a backup procedure is taking place. Instead, subdirectories are created under the GDS directory to maintain a record of files to be purged after save backup mode ends. A file is intended to survive system restarts and can span days, or even years. These files are a critical part of the overall state of the forms server and may include PDF files, policies, or form templates. If any of these files are lost or become corrupted, the processes on the forms server may become unstable and data could be lost.</p>
  <p>You can choose to perform snapshot backups, where you would usually enter backup mode for a period and then leave backup mode after you complete your backup activities. Leaving backup mode is required so that files can be purged from the GDS to ensure that it does not grow unnecessarily large. You can either leave backup mode explicitly or wait for the time to expire on a backup mode session. </p>
  <p>You can also leave your server in perpetual backup mode, which is typical for backup strategies for rolling backups or continuous system coverage. Rolling backup mode indicates that the system is always in backup mode, with a new backup mode session initiated as soon as the previous session is released. When in continuous backup mode, a file is purged after two backup mode session and is no longer referenced.</p>
  <p>You can use the Backup and Restore service to add to existing applications or new applications that you create to perform backups of the GDS or database connected to the forms server.</p>
  <note>
   <p>As with any other aspect of your AEM Forms implementation, your backup and recovery strategy should be developed and tested in a development or staging environment before being used in production to ensure that the entire solution is working as expected with no data loss.</p>
  </note>
  <p>You can perform these tasks using the Backup and Restore service:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Enter backup mode. </p></li>
   <li><p>Leave backup mode. </p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="entering_backup_mode_on_the_forms_server">Entering Backup Mode on the forms server</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>You enter backup mode to allow for hot backups of a forms server. When you enter backup mode, you specify the following information based on your organizationâ€™s backup procedures:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><p>A unique label to identify the backup mode session that may be useful for your backup processes.</p></li>
   <li><p>The time for the backup procedure to complete.</p></li>
   <li><p>A flag to indicate whether to be in continuous backup mode, which is useful only if you are performing rolling backups.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before you write applications to enter into backup mode, it is recommended that you understand the backup procedures that will be used after you put the forms server in backup mode. For more information about what to consider when performing backups for AEM Forms, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_admin_63">administration help</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="summary_of_steps">Summary of steps</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>To create an application that enters backup mode, perform the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><p>Include project files.</p></li>
   <li><p>Create an BackupService client object.</p></li>
   <li><p>Determine a unique label, the amount of time to perform the backup, and whether to be in continuous backup mode.</p></li>
   <li><p>Enter backup mode.</p></li>
   <li><p>(Optional) Retrieve information about the backup mode session on the server.</p></li>
   <li><p>Perform the backup of the GDS (Global Data Store) and database.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Include project files</strong></p>
  <p>Include necessary files in your development project. These files are important to include in your project for compiling your code properly and using the Backup and Restore Service API.</p>
  <p>For information about the location of these files, see <a href="/programming-with-aem-forms/invoking-aem-forms-using-java#including_aem_forms_java_library_files">Including AEM Forms Java library files</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Create a BackupService Client API object</strong></p>
  <p>To programmatically leave backup mode, you create a BackupService client object to use the Backup and Restore Service API. </p>
  <p><strong>Decide upon a unique label, determine the amount of time to perform the backup, and decide whether to be in continuous backup mode</strong></p>
  <p>Before you enter backup mode, you should decide upon a unique label, determine the amount of time that you want to allocate to perform the backup, and decide whether you want the forms server to stay in backup mode. These considerations are important to integrate with the backup procedures established by your organization. (See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_admin_63">administration help</a>.)</p>
  <p><strong>Enter backup mode</strong></p>
  <p>Enter backup mode with the parameters that are consistent with the backup procedures at your organization. </p>
  <p><strong>Retrieve information about the backup mode session on the server</strong></p>
  <p>After you enter backup mode, you can retrieve information about the session. This information can be used to integrate with your backup procedures</p>
  <p><strong>Perform the backup of the GDS and database</strong></p>
  <p>After you successfully enter backup mode, you can perform a backup of the Global Document Storage (GDS) and the database that the forms server is connected to. This step is specific to your organization, since you can perform this step manually or you can run other tools to perform the backup procedure.</p>
