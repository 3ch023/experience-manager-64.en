# Interactive Communications Overview{#interactive-communications-overview}

This article includes overview, sample use cases, creation workflow, and differences between Interactive Communication and letter.

 ![](assets/correspondence-management-1.png)

Interactive Communications centralizes and manages the creation, assembly, and delivery of secure, personalized, and interactive correspondences such as business correspondence, documents, statements, benefit notices, marketing mails, bills, and welcome kits.

## Key capabilities {#key-capabilities}

Following are the key capabilities of Interactive Communications:

* Out-of-the-box integration with form data model to enable easy and streamlined access to back end databases and other CRM systems, such as MSÂ® Dynamics
* Integrated authoring interface for print and web channels with ability to auto generate web channel from the print channel
* Charts to present information in easily understandable visual formats in print and web
* Document fragments support rule editor and form data model
* Agent user interface displays print and web preview of the Interactive Communication
* Drag-and-drop components to quickly construct print and web channels

## Sample use case {#sample-use-case}

The [Welcome kit for a credit card customer](../../forms/using/finance-reference-site-walkthrough.md#creditcardapplicationwalkthrough) sample use case showcases the capabilities of an Interactive Communication.

### Workflow {#workflow}

To create an Interactive Communication, have the [building blocks](#buildingblocks) for Interactive Communication ready and then complete the following steps:

1. Choose to [create an Interactive Communication](../../forms/using/create-interactive-communication.md).   

1. Specify the [form data model](../../forms/using/data-integration.md), prefill service, and [print and web channel templates](../../forms/using/web-channel-print-channel.md). You can choose to generate web channel from the print channel. 

1. Using the [drag-and-drop interface](../../forms/using/introduction-interactive-communication-authoring.md), add document fragments, images, components to print and web channel of the Interactive Communication as required. 
1. Configure the properties for the components inserted, such as the following:

    1. Images
    1. [Tables](../../forms/using/create-interactive-communication.md#tables) (Including Layout Fragments)
    1. [Charts](../../forms/using/chart-component-interactive-communications.md)
    1. [Document fragments](../../forms/using/create-interactive-communication.md#documentfragmentproperties)

1. Preview print and web channels and, if required, edit the Interactive Communication. 
1. The agent uses the Agent UI to [prepare the Interactive Communication](../../forms/using/prepare-send-interactive-communication.md) for sending it to the recipient/post process.

### Building blocks {#buildingblocks}

Following are the building blocks required for creating an Interactive Communication:

* [Form data model](../../forms/using/data-integration.md)
* [Print and web channel templates](../../forms/using/web-channel-print-channel.md)
* [Document fragments](../../forms/using/document-fragments.md)
* Images
* [Themes](../../forms/using/themes.md) for the Web channel

## Interactive Communications Vs Correspondence Management {#interactive-communications-vs-correspondence-management}

Interactive Communication is the default and recommended approach to create customer communications. To continue using the letters creating in AEM 6.3 Forms and AEM 6.2 Forms, you need to [install a compatibility package](../../forms/using/compatibility-package.md). Following is a comparison between capabilities of Interactive Communication and letter.
