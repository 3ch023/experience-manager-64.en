# Configuring SSL on Windows Vista{#configuring-ssl-on-windows-vista}

To configure SSL on Windows Vistaâ„¢, you need an SSL certificate with RSA keys for authentication. You can use the Java keytool to create the certificate.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Windows Vista will not work with DSA keys.

You can run keytool by using a single command that includes all the information that is required to create the certificate and keystore.

**Create an SSL certificate**

1. In a command prompt, navigate to *[JAVA HOME]*/bin and type the following command to create the certificate and keystore:

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Replace *[JAVA_HOME] with the directory where the JDK is installed, and replace the text in italic with values that correspond with your environment.*

1. Type `changeit` as the password. This password is the default for a Java installation, and the system administrator may have changed it.
