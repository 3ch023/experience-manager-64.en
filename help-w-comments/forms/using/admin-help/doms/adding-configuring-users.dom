  <p>User and group information is maintained in a third-party storage system, such as an LDAP directory. User Management does not write to the third-party storage system. Instead, User Management synchronizes the user and group information with its own database</p> 
  <h2 id="create_a_user">Create a user</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>When you create users, you can add the them to groups and assign roles to the them.</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In administration console, click Settings &amp;gt; User Management &amp;gt; Users and Groups, and click New User.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Under General Settings, provide information as required, and then click Next. For details about the settings, see <a href="adding-configuring-users#user_settings">User settings</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>(Optional) To add the user to a group, click Find Groups, and do these tasks: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><p>In the Find box, type all or part of the group name.</p></li> 
     <li><p>Select the domain to search, select the number of items to display, and click Find.</p></li> 
     <li><p>(Optional) To view group details, select the group name, and then click OK to return to the search results page.</p></li> 
     <li><p>Select the check box for the group and click OK.</p></li> 
     <li><p>Click Next.</p></li> 
    </ul></li> 
   <li><p>(Optional) To assign roles to the user, click Find Roles, select the check box for the roles to assign, and then click OK.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Click Finish.</p> 
    <note> 
     <p>If you enounter any login issue with the user, see <a href="/content/help/en/aem-forms/kb/AEM-users-fails-to-login" target="_blank">AEM Forms on JEE user fails to login on AEM Forms on OSGi side</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="user_settings">User settings</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Specify the following settings when you create or edit a user.</p> 
  <p><strong>Canonical Name: </strong>(Mandatory) Unique identifier for the user. Each user and group in a domain must have a unique canonical name. Select the System Generated checkbox to let User Management assign a unique value, or clear the checkbox and specify a custom value for the Canonical Name.</p> 
  <p>Avoid using underscore characters (_) in canonical names, for example, <span class="code">sample_user</span>. When you search for users based on their canonical name, those containing underscore characters are not returned.</p> 
  <p><strong>First Name: </strong>(Mandatory) User’s given name</p> 
  <p><strong>Last Name: </strong>(Mandatory) User’s family name</p> 
  <p><strong>Common Name: </strong>Full name or display name for the user. For example, if First Name = Gloria and Last Name = Rios, then Common Name = Gloria Rios.</p> 
  <p><strong>Email: </strong>User’s email address</p> 
  <p><strong>Telephone: </strong>User’s telephone number</p> 
  <p><strong>Description: </strong>Optional description. Use this field as suits your organization’s needs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Address: </strong>User’s mailing address</p> 
  <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Organization to which the user belongs</p> 
  <p><strong>Email Aliases:</strong> User’s email aliases. Separate the email aliases with commas.</p> 
  <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Domain to which the user belongs</p> 
  <p><strong>Locale: </strong>User’s ISO locale </p> 
  <p><strong>Business Calendar Key: </strong>Enables you to map a business calendar to a user, based on the value for this setting. Business calendars define business and non-business days. AEM forms can use business calendars when calculating future dates and times for events such as reminders, deadlines, and escalations. The way that you assign business calendar keys to users depends on whether you are using an enterprise, local, or hybrid domain. (See <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/adding-domains.md#adding-domains">Adding domains</a>.)</p> 
  <p>If you are using a local or hybrid domain, information about users is stored only in the User Management database. For these users, set the Business Calendar Key to a string. Then map the business calendar key (the string) to a business calendar in forms workflow. </p> 
  <p>If you are using an enterprise domain, information about users resides in a third-party storage system, such as an LDAP directory. User Management synchronizes user information from the directory with the User Management database. This feature allows you to map a business calendar key to a field in the LDAP directory. For example, consider a scenario where each user record in your directory contains a country field, and you want to assign business calendars based on the country where the user is located. In this case, you specify the country field name as the value for the Business Calendar Key setting. You can then map the business calendar keys (the values defined for the country field in the LDAP directory) to business calendars in forms workflow. </p> 
  <p>For additional information on business calendars, including how to map business calendar keys to business calendars, see <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/configuring-business-calendars.md#configuring-business-calendars">Configuring Business Calendars</a>. </p> 
  <p>Limit the name to less than 53 characters. A shorter name helps prevent problems displaying the business calendar key in the Process Management pages in administration console.</p> 
  <p><strong>User ID: </strong>(Mandatory) User ID that the user uses to log in. User ID is not case sensitive and it must be unique across the domain.</p> 
  <p>In enterprise domains, use a non-DN attribute as the user ID because a user’s DN can change if they move to another part of the organization. This setting depends on the directory server. The value is <span class="code">objectGUID</span> for Active Directory 2003, <span class="code">nsuniqueID</span> for Sun™ One, and <span class="code">guid</span> for eDirectory. </p> 
  <p>Ensure that the user ID is unique. Do not use one that was assigned to a deleted user. </p> 
  <p>AEM forms cannot differentiate between user accounts that have identical user IDs and passwords but belong to different domains. To avoid this problem, do not create accounts that have the same user ID on multiple domains.</p> 
  <p>When using SQL Server as your database, you cannot create a user ID that exceeds 255 characters. </p> 
  <p>When using MySQL, the user ID can contain extended characters. However, when a comparison is made between two strings, such as abcde and âbcdè, they are considered the same. For example, when syncing, if a new user was added to the database, a comparison is made to check whether a user with the same user ID exists in the database. If user <i>abcde</i> already exists in the database when the new user <i>âbcdè </i> is added, the comparison cannot distinguish between the two names. It is assumed that the user already exists in the database, and the new user is ignored and not added.</p>

  <p>Avoid creating user names that begin with a number sign (#). Performing task searches returns no results for those user names. (See <a href="../../../forms/using/admin-help/tasks.md#working-with-tasks">Working with tasks</a>.) </p> 
  <p><strong>Password and Confirm Password: </strong>Password the user uses to log in. It must have a minimum of eight characters. A password is not required for a user who is part of a hybrid domain.</p>

  <note> 
   <p>AEM Forms on JEE also allows users of the AEM forms add-on running on an OSGi to be recognized as AEM users. This is required for scenarios where single sign-on between AEM Forms on JEE and AEM forms add-on running on an OSGi is required (for example, HTML workspace). The above-mentioned delete operation removes a user only from AEM Forms on JEE. The user is not deleted from AEM Forms add-on running on OSGi environment. But any login attempt made after deleting the user (a login attempt to AEM Forms add-on JEE server or AEM Forms add-on on OSGi environment) is denied.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h2 id="create_custom_login_error_handler">Create custom login error handler</h2> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>If a user without the required AEM forms and CQ permissions, attempts to log into the following applications embedded in CQ, the user is redirected to the default CQ 404 page containing the error trace:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Correspondence Management solution</p></li> 
   <li><p>AEM forms Workspace</p></li> 
   <li><p>forms manager</p></li> 
   <li><p>Process Reporting</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>CQ provides a mechanism to override the default 404 handler jsp.</p> 
  <p>For details on how to to customize the error handling page, see <a href="http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/customizing_error_handler_pages.html">Customizing Pages shown by the Error Handler</a> in the Adobe Experience Manager Documentation.</p>
