1. Log in to the Acrobat Reader DC extensions web application at http://localhost:*[port]*/ReaderExtensions (where *[port]* is your application server’s port number).
1. Click Browse to upload the PDF file and then click Info. The information appears below the filename.

   See Acrobat Reader DC extensions Help for details on modifying the file’s usage rights.
