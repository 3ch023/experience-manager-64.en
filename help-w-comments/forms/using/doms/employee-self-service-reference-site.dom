  <h2>Prerequisite</h2>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Employee self-service systems, generally hosted on company's Intranet, give employees access to a host of information and services that they can avail from their desks. It empowers and gives complete control to employees to perform actions such as accessing their employment details, applying for leave, and submitting expense reports. On the other hand, it helps organizations improve process efficiencies and cut costs while keeping employees informed and engaged.</p> 
  <p>Employee self-service reference site showcases how you can leverage AEM Forms to implement employee self-services system in your organization.</p> 
  <note>

However, you can run these use cases and review artifacts using We.Gov as well. To do so, you must replace <strong>we-finance</strong> with <strong>we-gov</strong> in the mentioned URLs.</p>
