  <h2>Pre-requisite</h2> 
  <p>Set up your We.Gov reference site as described in the <a href="../../forms/using/setup-reference-sites.md">Set up and configure AEM Forms reference sites</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Reference site scenario</h2> 
  <p>We.Gov is a state run organization that lets adoptive parents enroll for child support if they adopted a child. The site manages the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Eligibility of the applicant, the adoptive parent</li> 
   <li>Personal and professional details of the applicant (if the applicant is eligible for child support)</li> 
   <li>Personal details of the adopted child<br /> Applicant can provide details for more than one child</li> 
   <li>Bank account details of the applicant in which the applicant can receive child support benefits</li> 
   <li>Recovery of application fee</li> 
   <li>Assessment of the application</li> 
   <li>Approval of the application</li> 
   <li>Automated communication to the applicant</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Once the application is submitted and its fee is paid, the applicant receives an email from the organization with the acknowledgement of submitted application.</p> 
  <p>The We.Gov organization receives the application. The organization gets the application assessed, and approves the applications that are genuine. </p> 
  <p>After the application is approved, the applicant receives an email from the We.Gov site. The <strong>View Document </strong>option in the email links to a document with the enrollment details of the applicant. </p> 
  <p>The infographic below shows the step-by-step workflow of the We.Gov reference site scenario. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/workflow_aem_gov_2.png" /> 
  <p>The scenario involves the following personas:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Sarah Rose, the adoptive parent who requests for child support</li> 
   <li>Joe, the adopted child</li> 
   <li>Gloria Rios, the head of approval division, We.Gov</li> 
   <li>Conard Simms, the field agent who takes care of application assessment</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Sarah initiates her eligibility check</h2> 
  <p>An applicant can check eligibility to request child support benefits. The site lets users answer questions to let them determine if their application is eligible for benefits. Sarah, an adoptive parent, is a prospective applicant for it. Eligibility form is a part of the Application for Child Support services of the We.Gov site. To check her eligibility, Sarah clicks <strong>Child Support </strong>on the We.Gov website. In the Child Support page, Sarah clicks <strong>Check Your Eligibility</strong>. </p> 
  <p>In addition to the above approach, Sarah can click <strong>Get Started</strong> on the homepage. Sarah is navigated to the All Applications page, where she can click Apply under <strong>Application for Child Support Services</strong>. Sarah is then taken to the eligibility check. </p> 
  <p>In the Check Eligibility For Child Support page, Sarah is asked a set of questions to determine her eligibility for child support benefits. Through the set of questions, she is asked:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>If she is the custodial parent of the child</li> 
   <li>If she and the child live in the state of GX</li> 
   <li>The age group of the child and child's education.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Sarah answers these questions, and her eligibility is validated. Her answers determine if she is eligible for child support. </p> 
  <p>Sarah is informed that she is eligible for child support, and the application fee is $25.</p> 
  <h3>How it works</h3> 
  <p>Sarah's eligibility is validated through an eligibility barrier created using rule editor. The rule editor lets you specify conditions that are met before an applicant can fill the application form. When Sarah, the applicant, meets all the eligibility conditions, she lands on the application form. </p> 
  <p>The eligibility check is a part of the child support application adaptive form. The rule validates eligibility when:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The applicant is a custodial parent</li> 
   <li>The applicant and the child stay in the state of GX</li> 
   <li>The applicant has the main day-to-day care of the child</li> 
   <li>The age of the child getting support services coverage is under 16 years.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>See it yourself</h3> 
  <p>In your browser, open <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;PublishPort&amp;gt;/content/we-gov/en.html</span>. In the We.Gov site, click Child Support. In the Child Support page, click Check Your Eligibility.</p> 
  <p>To see the rules:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Open the form in edit mode on the author instance. URL: <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;AuthorPort&amp;gt;/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-gov/child-support/css.html</span>.</li> 
   <li>Select a component and click <img src="assets/edit-rules.png" />.<br /> The Rule Editor opens listing all the rules applied in the form.<br /> </li> 
   <li>In the left side panel, click rules <span class="code">passMsg</span> and <span class="code">failMsg</span> to understand how the eligibility check works.<br /> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>Sarah starts her application for child support</h2> 
  <p>Sarah clicks <strong>Start Application</strong> after she is informed of her eligibility for child support.<br /> In the Application For Child Support Services page, Sarah provides details in the following sections:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>About Applicant</strong>: Lets Sarah provide her details in this section.<br /> </li> 
   <li><strong>Child Information</strong>: Lets Sarah provide child's information, who is covered under support services. <br /> </li> 
   <li><strong>Payment</strong>: Lets Sarah provide her bank details in which We.Gov can deposit monthly support compensation.<br /> </li> 
   <li><strong>Fee Payment</strong>: Lets Sarah provide her credit card details to pay for the application fee.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>By default, Sarah is taken to the <strong>About Applicant</strong> section. </p> 
  <img alt="Child support application on desktop" imageRotate="0" src="assets/desktop.png" title="Child support application on desktop" /> 
  <p>At any time, Sarah can click <strong>Come back later</strong> and resume with her application. When she clicks <strong>Come back later</strong>, her progress is saved as a draft, and she gets an option to email the draft.</p> 
  <p>When she clicks <strong>Send Email</strong>, she receives an email with a link to the draft of her form. </p> 
  <p>The child support form on We.Gov site uses adaptive forms. She can use the link in her email, and fill the form on her mobile device. </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>The resume-from-email workflow works with logged in users only. In the reference site scenario, ensure that the user Sarah Rose is added. Sarah's login credentials are <span class="code">srose/password</span>. </p> 
  </note> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/mob1.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah can provide details in any section, but the application fee is accepted only after she provides required information in all the sections. An application is incomplete without fee payment, and fields marked with an asterisk are required.</p> 
  <h3>&lt;strong&gt;Sarah provides her information&lt;/strong&gt;</h3> 
  <p>After Sarah clicks <strong>Start Application</strong>, she is taken to the Applicant Information section of the Application For Child Support Services page. Under Applicant Information, Sarah navigates through the tabs and provides her personal information for the application. She clicks <strong>Next </strong>to navigate through the tabs. <br /> <br /> </p> 
  <p>Under Applicant Information, she is asked to provide details under the following tabs:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Basic Information<br /> </strong>Under Basic Information, Sarah provides her ID proof and her personal information. Sarah’s personal information includes her name, email ID, and social security number.</li> 
   <li><strong>Relationship<br /> </strong>Under Relationship, Sarah enters information about her marital status. </li> 
   <li><strong>Additional Information<br /> </strong>Under Additional Information, Sarah enters an ID number, her date of birth, and current address and phone number.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Sarah provides child information</h3> 
  <p>After Sarah provides her personal information and clicks <strong>Next</strong>, she is taken to the Child Information section.</p> 
  <p>In the Child Information section, she provides the following details: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Number of children to claim child support services</li> 
   <li>Child’s name, social security number, date of birth, and place of birth</li> 
  </ul> 
  <div>
    If Sarah chooses more than one child, she gets extra forms enabled with the same details to fill. 
   <br /> Sarah chooses her single child, Joe, and enters his name. 
  </div> 
  <h3>Sarah provides payment information</h3> 
  <p>After Sarah provides information of the adopted child (or children) and clicks <strong>Next</strong>, she is taken to the Payment Information section.</p> 
  <p>In the Payment Information section, she provides the bank account details in which she can receive the child support benefits.<br /> She enters her 10-digit bank account number.</p> 
  <h2>Sarah pays the application fee and signs the form</h2> 
  <p>After Sarah agrees to the terms and conditions of the application, she pays the application fee of $25. Application fee is required to process her application.<br /> Sarah enters her credit card details and clicks <strong>Pay Now</strong>. After paying the fees, a PDF version of the application appears with a signature field. </p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/sarah-sign-1.png" /> 
  <p>Sarah can choose either to type in, use draw to handwrite, insert an image of signature, or use her mobile's touchscreen to draw her signature. Sarah types in her name and clicks Click To Sign. </p> 
  <p>Her application is submitted to the We.Gov site. </p> 
  <h3>&lt;strong&gt;Sarah receives an acknowledgement email&lt;/strong&gt;</h3> 
  <p>After Sarah pays the application fee, she receives an acknowledgement email from the We.Gov site.<br /> We.Gov processes the application, and Sarah is informed she will receive monthly compensation after her application is approved.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/sarah-ack-email.png" /> 
  <h3>How it works</h3> 
  <p>The child support application uses a combination of panel layouts such as top tab, wizard, and accordion to create the experience. It uses a form template called We.Gov Child Template.</p> 
  <p>The applicant can move across sections to fill different components of the form. When the applicant fills the form, submits it, agrees to the terms and conditions, and pays the fee, a custom workflow is initiated. The custom workflow sends an automated email to the applicant acknowledging application submission. The application is forwarded to the organization's concerned department for verification and approval. </p> 
  <p>The layout of the form is specified in the Gov Child Support Service Theme. Styling includes component style, page background, error state formatting of components, and font styles. </p> 
  <p>The eligibility check uses rules specified in the form. It uses validity checks specified below:</p> 
  <p><span class="code">SHOW passMsgWHEN (Does the child live in the state of GX? is equal to Yes) AND (Do you live in the state of GX? is equal to Yes) AND ( (Who has the main day-to-day care of the child? is equal to You) AND (Are you: is equal to The custodial parent) ) AND (Is the child you are applying for: is equal to Under 16 years) ELSE Hide</span></p> 
  <p><span class="code">HIDE failMsg WHEN (Does the child lives in the state of GX? is equal to Yes) AND ( (Do you live in the state of GX? is equal to Yes) AND (Who has the main day-to-day care of the child? is equal to You) ) AND (Is the child you are applying for: is equal to Under 16 years) AND (Are you: is equal to The custodial parent) ELSE Show</span></p> 
  <h3>See it yourself</h3> 
  <p>In your browser, open <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;PublishPort&amp;gt;/content/forms/af/we-gov/child-support/css.html</span> and fill the required information. When you submit the application after you fill the required information, pay the fees, and sign the document, you receive the acknowledgement email. </p>
