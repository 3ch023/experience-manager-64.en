  <p style="background-color: #FEF49F; font-size: 110%;">For information about latest features and enhancements in AEM Forms, see <a href="../../forms/using/whats-new.md" target="_blank">What's new in AEM Forms</a>.</p>
  <h2>About AEM Forms</h2>
  <p>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) provides an easy-to-use solution to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating with back-end processes, business rules, and data.</p> 
  <p>AEM Forms combine form authoring, management, and publishing along with correspondence management capabilities, document security, and integrated analytics to create engaging end-to-end experiences. Designed to work across web and mobile channels, AEM Forms can be efficiently integrated into your business processes, reducing paper processes and errors while improving efficiency. </p> 
  <p>AEM Forms leverages and extends the capabilities of your existing investments in XFA forms and Adobe LiveCycle solution. For details, see <a href="/forms/using/aem-forms-complement-xfa-livecycle-processes" target="_blank">AEM Forms - securing and extending your existing forms ecosystem</a>.</p> 
  <p>In large enterprises, forms are often created once and reused by copying to a content management system. Keeping a large database of forms up-to-date and making them discoverable can be a considerable challenge. AEM provides a customizable Forms Portal that ensures that customers find and access forms they need across both web and mobile channels.</p> 
  <p>AEM Forms provides forms management tools that not only lets you manage adaptive form, but XFA forms, PDF forms, and related assets as well. For more information, see <a href="../../forms/using/introduction-managing-forms.md" target="_blank">Introduction to managing forms</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>HTML forms</strong></p> 
  <p>HTML5 browser-based forms can be viewed on both mobile devices and desktop browsers. You can electronically sign HTML forms using Scribble or eSign services.</p> 
  <p><strong>Adaptive forms</strong></p>

  <p>AEM Forms provide Forms Workspace, a mobile application that extends your digital business processes to mobile devices. Using Forms Workspace, you can collect and record data even when offline. Forms Workspace leverages the capabilities of your mobile device, and lets you capture photos, videos, and collect data such as timestamps and other information.
