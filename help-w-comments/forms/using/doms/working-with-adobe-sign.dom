  <p>Adobe Sign enables e-signature workflows for adaptive forms. E-Signatures improve workflows to process documents for legal, sales, payroll, human resource management, and more areas.</p> 
  <p>In a typical Adobe Sign and adaptive forms scenario, a user fills an adaptive form to apply for a service. For example, a mortgage and credit-card application requires legal Signatures from all the borrowers and co-applicants. To enable electronic-signature workflows for similar scenarios, you can integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms. A few more examples are, you can use Adobe Sign to:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Close deals from any device with fully automated proposal, quote, and contract processes.</li> 
   <li>Finish Human Resource processes faster and give your employees the digital experiences.</li> 
   <li>Cut contract cycle times and onboard your vendors faster. </li> 
   <li>Create digital workflows that automate common processes.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Adobe Sign integration with AEM Forms supports:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Single and multiple-user signing workflows</li> 
   <li>Sequential and simultaneous signing workflows </li> 
   <li>In-form and out-of-form signing experiences</li> 
   <li>Signing forms as an anonymous or logged-in user</li> 
   <li>Dynamic signing processes (integration with AEM Forms workflow)</li> 
   <li>Authentication through a knowledge base, phone, and social profiles<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
  <p>Before using Adobe Sign in an adaptive form:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Ensure AEM Forms cloud service is configured to use Adobe Sign. For details, see <a href="../../forms/using/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md" target="_blank">Integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms</a>.</li> 
   <li>Keep the list of signers ready. You require at least an email address for every signer. </li> 
  </ul>

  </ol> 
  <h3 id="AddAdobeSignfieldstoanadaptiveform">Add Adobe Sign fields to an adaptive form</h3> 
  <p>Adobe Sign has various fields that can be placed on an adaptive form. These fields accept various types of data such as signatures, initials, company, or title and help collect extra information during signing, along with the signatures. You can use the Adobe Sign Block component to place Adobe Sign fields at various locations in an adaptive form. </p> 
  <p>Perform the following steps to add fields to an adaptive form and customize various options related to these fields:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Drag-and-drop <strong>Adobe Sign Block</strong> component from the component browser to the adaptive form. The Adobe Sign Block component has all the supported Adobe Sign fields. By default, it adds a <strong>Signature </strong>field to the adaptive form.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/sign-block.png" /><p>By default, the Adobe Sign Block is not visible in the published adaptive form. It is visible only in the signing documents. You can change the visibility of Adobe Sign Block from the properties of the Adobe Sign Block component.</p> 
    <note> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Using Adobe Sign block is not mandatory to use Adobe Sign in an adaptive form. If you do not use Adobe Sign block and add fields for the signers, then the default signature field is displayed at the bottom of the signing documents. <br /> </li> 
      <li>Use Adobe Sign block only for those adptive forms which automatically generate Document of Record. If you are using a custom XDP for generating Document of Record or a form template based adaptive form, Adobe Sign block is not required. </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p> </p> 
    </note></li> 
   <li><p>Select the <strong>Adobe Sign Block</strong> component and tap the <strong>Edit </strong><img src="assets/aem_6_3_edit.png" /> icon.

It make tracking and reporting of signed documents easier. For example, An bank has multiple departments. You can have a separate configuration for each department for better tracking of the documents.</p> 
  <p>A document can also have multiple signers. For example, a credit-card application can have mutiple applicants. A bank requires signatures of all the applicants before starting processing application. For multi-signer scenarios, you can select to sign the document in sequential or simultaneous order.</p> 
  <p>Perform the following steps to select a cloud service and order of signing:</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cloud-service.png" />

   <li><img imageRotate="0" src="assets/phone-details.png" /><p>Click the <strong>Edit </strong><img src="assets/aem_6_3_edit.png" /> icon to specify the following information about the signer:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Title: </strong>Specify a title to uniquely identify a signer. <br /> </li> 
     <li><strong>Is the signer and the person filling the form same?: </strong>Select <strong>Yes</strong>, if form filler and first signer are the same person. If the option is set to <strong>No,</strong> then do not use the signature step component in the adaptive form. If the form contains a Signature Step component, then the field is automaticallly set to Yes.<br /> </li> 
     <li><strong>Signer Email address: </strong>Specify email address of the signer. Signer receives to be signed documents/form on the specified email address. You can choose to use an email address provided in a form field, in AEM user profile of the logged-in user, or manually enter an email address. It is a mandatory step. Also note, if you have configured only one signer, ensure that the email address of the signer is not identical to Adobe Sign account used to configure AEM cloud services.<br /> </li> 
     <li><strong>Signer Authentication Method:</strong> Specify the method to authenticate a user before opening a form for signing. You can choose between phone, knowledge base, and social identity-based authentication.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <note> 
     <ul> 
      <li>By default, the social identity-based authentication provides an option to authenticate using Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn. You can contact Adobe Sign support to enable other social authentication providers.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p> </p> 
    </note> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Adobe Sign fields to fill or sign:</strong> Select Adobe Sign fields for the signer. An adaptive form can have multiple Adobe Sign fields. You can choose to enable specific fields for a signer. The field displays all the available Adobe Sign Blocks. When you select a block, all the fields of the block are selected.

  <p>After you, add Adobe Sign fields to an adaptive form, enable Adobe Sign from form container, select Adobe Sign Cloud Service, and add Adobe Sign Signers, select an appropriate submit action for the adaptive form. For detailed information about adaptive forms submit actions, see <a href="../../forms/using/configuring-submit-actions.md" target="_blank">Configuring the Submit action</a>.</p> 
  <p>Also, an Adobe Sign enabled adaptive form is submitted only after all the signers sign the form. You can find partially signed form in Pending Sign section of forms portal. Adobe Sign Configuration Service keeps polling Adobe Sign server at <a href="../../forms/using/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md">regular intervals</a> to verify the status of signatures. If all the signers complete signing the form, the submit action service is started and the form is submitted. If you are using a custom submit action and the form uses Adobe Sign, update your custom submit action to use the submit action service.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>Data of the adaptive form is stored temporarily on Forms Portal. It is recommeded to use <a href="../../forms/using/configuring-draft-submission-storage.md" target="_blank">custom storage for Forms Portal</a>. It ensures that the PII (personally identifiable information) data is not stored on AEM servers.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p>Your form signing experience is ready. You can preview the form to verify the signing experience. On the published form, Adobe Sign Block fields are displayed when a signer receives the form for signing through an email. This experience is also known as out-of-form signing experience. You can also configure an in-form signing experience for the first signer, for detailed steps see <a href="../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md#main-pars-header-1337036673">Create in-form signing experience</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Configure cloud signatures for an adaptive form</h2> 
  <p>Cloud-based digital signatures or remote signatures are a new generation of digital signatures that work across desktop, mobile, and the web — and meet the highest levels of compliance and assurance for signer authentication. You can sign an adaptive form with cloud-based digital signatures. </p> 
  <p>After <a href="../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md#main-pars-header-46741052">editing adaptive form properties for Adobe sign</a>, perform the following steps to add cloud signature field to an adaptive form:</p>

  <h3>Configure the thank you page or summary step component</h3> 
  <p>The <strong>Summary Step</strong> component automatically submits the form, populates the information inside the customized Summary page, and displays the summary of the submitted form. It also gets the required information in the return map. The Summary Step component takes up full width available for the form. It is recommended to not have any other component on the section containing the Summary Step component.</p> 
  <p>Now, the in form signing experience is ready. You can preview the form to verify the signing experience.</p> 
  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2> 
  <p><strong>Ans:</strong> No, AEM Forms does not support using an adaptive form that embeds an Adobe Sign enabled adaptive form for signing</p> 
  <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Adaptive form created using the advanced template is configured to use Adobe Sign. To resolve the error, create and select an Adobe Sign cloud configuration and configure an Adobe Sign signer for the adaptive form.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Yes, you can use text tags in a text component to add Adobe Sign fields to a <a href="../../forms/using/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.md" target="_blank">Document of Record</a> (Auto generated document of record option only) enabled adaptive form. To learn about the procedure and rules to create a text tag, see <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/help/text-tags.html">Adobe Sign Documentation</a>. Also note, Adaptive forms has a limited support for text tags. You can use the text tags to create only those fields that <a href="../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md#main-pars-header-1373840282">Adobe Sign Block</a> supports.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ans: </strong>You can use both the components simultaneously in a form. Here are a few recommendations for using these components:</p> 
  <p><strong>Adobe Sign Block:</strong> You can use the Adobe Sign Block to add Adobe Sign fields anywhere on the adaptive form. It also helps to assign specific fields to signers. When an adaptive form is previewed or published Adobe Sign Block is not visible, by default. These blocks are enabled only in the signing document. In the signing document, only the fields assigned to a signer are enabled. Adobe Sign block can be used with first and subsequent signers.</p> 
  <p><strong>Signature step component:</strong> You can use the signature step component to create in-form signing experience. It allows only the first signer to sign while the form is being filled. When the section containing the Signature Step component is rendered, it displays a signable PDF version of the form. It is generally the last or penultimate section followed by summary component of a form.<br /> </p>
