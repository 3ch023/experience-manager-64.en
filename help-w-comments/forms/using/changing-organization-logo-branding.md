# Changing the organization logo for branding{#changing-the-organization-logo-for-branding}

The organization logo is displayed at the upper-left corner of AEM Forms workspace. To update the logo, follow the [Generic steps of AEM Forms workspace customization](../../forms/using/generic-steps-html-workspace-customization.md#generic-steps-for-html-workspace-customization) and then the following steps.

1. Create a logo and name the file as `NewWorkspace.png`. Place the image file in /apps/ws/images folder using a WebDAV client.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The recommended size of the logo image is 218 px Ã— 20 px.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For more information about WebDAV access, see [http://dev.day.com/docs/en/crx/current/how_to/webdav_access.html](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/crx/current/how_to/webdav_access.html).

1. Reference the new logo image in style sheet at /apps/ws/css/newStyle.css by adding following style.

   ```css
   #logo {
   
          background: url(../images/NewWorkspace.png) no-repeat 14px 11px;
   
   }
   ```
