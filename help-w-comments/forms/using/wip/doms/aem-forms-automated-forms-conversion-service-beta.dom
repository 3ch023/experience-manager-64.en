  <p>Welcome to the AEM Automated Forms Conversion prerelease program. Read on for resources and instructions to get started and make the best of the prerelease program.</p> 
  <p>Automated Forms Conversion service by AEM Forms helps accelerate digitization and modernization of data capture experience through automated conversion of legacy print forms to adaptive forms. The service, powered by Adobe Sensei, automatically converts your PDF forms to device-friendly and responsive adaptive forms. While leveraging the existing investments in PDF Forms, the service can automatically apply appropriate validations to adaptive form fields during conversion.</p>

  <h2>Known issues and workarounds</h2>
  <p>Before you begin using AEM Forms Automated Forms Conversion service, review the following known issues and available workarounds.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><a href="../../../forms/using/wip/convert-existing-forms-to-adaptive-forms.md#main-pars-header-1222828150" target="_blank">Source folder</a> should not have more than 15 forms and 50 pages in total. The size of the source folder should not exceed 10 MB. Do not create sub-folders in the source folder. </li> 
   <li>PDF Forms with the dynamic layout, dotted outline, and filled or colored fields are not supported.</li> 
   <li>Images and text inside the images are not identified. Manually add images to converted forms.<br /> </li> 
   <li>Only simple tables, with empty fields, proper headers, and clear boundaries are supported. Complex tables like borderless tables, nested tables, table with colored rows, and tables with placeholder values are not supported. Use <a href="https://chl-author-preview.corp.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager/6-4/forms/using/wip/review-correct-ui-edited.html#main-pars_header_1182718738">adaptive form editor</a> to add or modify complex tables, after the conversion.<br /> </li> 
   <li>Review and Correct editor does not support form fragments and tables. Use <a href="https://chl-author-preview.corp.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager/6-4/forms/using/wip/review-correct-ui-edited.html#main-pars_header_1182718738">adaptive form editor</a> to fix conversions that had the <strong>Extract Fragment</strong> or <strong>Existing Fragments</strong> option enabled during conversions and fix table-related issues.<br /> </li> 
   <li>Review and Correct editor does not have undo action. The Save button saves the changes permanently.</li> 
   <li>Some form objects are easily visible to the human eye but are <a href="../../../forms/using/wip/styles-and-pattern--considerations-and-best-practices-.md" target="_blank">difficult to identify for the service</a>. Use <a href="../../../forms/using/wip/review-correct-ui-edited.md">Review and correct editor</a> to identify and convert such form objects.</li> 
   <li>When a choice group is deleted and manually recognized/drawn in Review and Correct editor, the text of the choice group are not extracted. Draw the field or text component to extract the text.</li> 
   <li>When the source document is a dynamic XFA (.XDP) and it<a href="../../../forms/using/xfa-api-supported-in-adaptive-form.md#supportedxfaelementsandtheirmappinginadaptiveformsbr"> defines behavior of XFA properties in an adaptive form</a>, then the following are not supported:
    <ul> 
     <li>XFA-based scripts of source documents are ported to output adaptive forms.</li> 
     <li>Presence property of source document is not honored. For example, a field in source document is marked hidden and a script makes the field visible, then the field remains visible in the output adaptive form.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Share feedback</h2>
  <p>Your feedback is important as it helps us improve our offerings. To share your experiences and report feedback on the conversion service and related documentation, log a JIRA issue with the details listed in table below.<br /> </p> 
  <h3>Before you start</h3>
  <ul> 
   <li>Add the source PDF form and produced adaptive form to an archive. Create and add these to a collateral zip/archive.</li> 
   <li>Take screen-shots or create video recordings of any issue encountered in Review and Correct editor. Add the screen-shot or video to collateral zip/archive.</li> 
   <li>Identify and report the visual patterns with proper screenshots or videos. For example, fields with a caption at the bottom are not be extracted in many forms, choice groups with circular widget are not working in many forms, and similar reoccurring issues. Do not report each and every issue related to missed fields.</li> 
  </ul>
