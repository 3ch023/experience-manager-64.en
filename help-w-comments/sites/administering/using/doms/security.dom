   <p>suspect there's not much that can be recycled, but just in case, the MAC user/group admin is/was documented under:</p> 
   <p>http://ec2author.day.com:8080/content/docs/en/marketing-cloud/user-group-admin.html</p> 
  </draft-comment> 
  <p>This chapter describes how to configure and maintain user authorization and also describes the theory behind how authentication and authorization work in AEM.</p> 
  <h2>Users and Groups in AEM</h2> 
  <p>This section deals with the various entities and related concepts in more detail to help you configure an easy to maintain user management concept.</p> 
  <h4>Users</h4> 
  <p>Users will log in to AEM with their account. Each user account is unique and holds the basic account details, together with the privileges assigned.</p> 
  <p>Users are often members of Groups, which simplify the allocation of these permissions and/or privileges.</p> 
  <h4>Groups</h4> 
  <p>Groups are collections of users and/or other groups; these are all called Members of a group.</p> 
  <p>Their primary purpose is to simplify the maintenance process by reducing the number of entities to be updated, as a change made to a group is applied to all members of the group. Groups often reflect:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>a role within the application; such as someone who is allowed to surf the content, or someone who is allowed to contribute content.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>your own organization; you may want to extend the roles to differentiate between contributors from different departments when they are restricted to different branches in the content tree.</p> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Therefore groups tend to remain stable, whereas users come and go more frequently.</p> 
  <p>With planning and a clean structure, the use of groups can reflect your structure, giving you a clear overview and an efficient mechanism for updates.</p> 
  <h4>Built-in Users and Groups</h4> 
  <p>AEM WCM installs a number of users and groups. These can be seen when you first access the Security Console after installation.</p> 
  <p>The following tables list each item together with:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>a short description<br /> </li> 
   <li>any recommendations about necessary changes<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><i>Please change all default passwords</i> (if you do not delete the account itself in certain circumstances).</p>

  <h2>Permissions in AEM</h2> 
  <p>AEM uses ACLs to determine what actions a user or group and can take and where it can perform those actions.<br /> </p> 
  <h3>Permissions and ACLs</h3> 
  <p>Permissions define who is allowed to perform which actions on a resource. The permissions are the result of <a href="security#Access%20Control%20Lists%20and%20how%20they%20are%20evaluated">access control</a> evaluations.<br /> </p> 
  <p>You can change the permissions granted/denied to a given user by selecting or clearing the checkboxes for the individual AEM <a href="security#Actions">actions</a>. A check mark indicates that an action is allowed. No checkmark indicates that an action is denied.<br /> </p> 
  <p>Where the checkmark is located in the grid also indicates what permissions users have in what locations within AEM (that is, which paths).</p> 
  <h3>Actions</h3> 
  <p>Actions can be performed on a page (resource). For each page in the hierarchy, you can specify which action the user is allowed to take on that page. <a href="security.html?#Permissions%20and%20ACLs">Permissions</a> enable you to allow or deny an action.</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong>Action </strong></td> 
     <td><strong>Description </strong></td>

     <td><p>The user can:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>modify existing content on the page and on any child pages.</li> 
       <li>create new paragraphs on the page or on any child page.</li> 
      </ul> <p>At the JCR level, users can modify a resource by modifying its properties, locking, versioning, nt-modifications, and they have complete write permission on nodes defining a jcr:content child node, for example cq:Page, nt:file, cq:Asset.</p> </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Create</td> 
     <td><p>The user can:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>create a new page or child page.</li> 
      </ul> <p>If <strong>modify</strong> is denied the subtrees below jcr:content are specifically excluded because the creation of jcr:content and its child nodes are considered a page modification. This only applies to nodes defining a jcr:content child node.<br /> </p> </td>

     <td>Delete</td> 
     <td><p>The user can:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>delete existing paragraphs from the page or any child page.</li> 
       <li>delete a page or child page.</li> 
      </ul> <p>If <strong>modify</strong> is denied any subtrees below jcr:content are specifically excluded as removing jcr:content and its child nodes is considered a page modification. This only applies to nodes defining a jcr:content child node.</p> </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Read ACL</td> 
     <td>The user can read the access control list of the page or child pages.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Edit ACL</td> 
     <td>The user can modify the access control list of the page or any child pages.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Replicate</td> 
     <td>The user can replicate content to another environment (for example, the Publish environment). The privilege is also applied to any child pages.</td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <note> 
   <p>AEM automatically generates user groups for role-assignment (Owner, Editor, Viewer) in <a href="../../../assets/using/managing-collections-touch-ui.md">Collections</a>. However, manually adding ACLs for such groups can introduce security vulnerabilities within AEM. Adobe recommends that you avoid adding ACLs manually.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Access Control Lists and how they are evaluated</h3> 
  <p>AEM WCM uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to organize the permissions being applied to the various pages.</p> 
  <p>Access Control Lists are made up of the individual permissions and are used to determine the order in which these permissions are actually applied. The list is formed according to the hierarchy of the pages under consideration. This list is then scanned bottom-up until the first appropriate permission to apply to a page is found.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>There are ACLs that are included with the samples. It is recommended that you review and determine what is appropriate for your applications. To review the ACLs that are included, go to <strong>CRXDE </strong>and select the <strong>Access Control</strong> tab for the following nodes:</p> 
   <p><br /> <span class="code">/etc/cloudservices/facebookconnect/geometrixx-outdoorsfacebookapp</span>: Allows everyone read access.<br /> <br /> <span class="code">/etc/cloudservices/twitterconnect/geometrixx-outdoors-twitter-app</span>: Allows everyone read access.<br /> <br /> <span class="code">/home/users/geometrixx-outdoors</span>: Allows everyone read access for <span class="code">*/profile*</span> and<br /> <span class="code">*/social/relationships/following/*</span>.</p> 
   <p><br /> Your custom application may set access for other relationships, such as <span class="code">*/social/relationships/friend/*</span> or <span class="code">*/social/relationships/pending-following/*</span>.<br /> <br /> When you create ACLs specific to communities, members joining those communities may be granted additional permissions. For example, this could be the case when users join the communities at <span class="code">/content/geometrixx-outdoors/en/community/hiking</span> or <span class="code">/content/geometrixx-outdoors/en/community/winter-sports</span>.<br /> </p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Permission States</h3> 
  <note> 
   <p>For CQ 5.3 users:</p> 
   <p>In contrast to previous CQ versions, <strong>create</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> should no longer be granted if a user only needs to modify pages. Instead, grant the <strong>modify</strong> action only if you want users to be able to create, modify, or delete components on existing pages.</p> 
   <p>For backwards compatibility reasons, the tests for actions does not take the special treatment of nodes defining <strong>jcr:content</strong> into account.</p>

  <note> 
   <p>If no permissions are defined for a page then all actions are denied.</p> 
  </note> 
  <p>The following are recommendations about managing access control lists:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Do not assign permissions directly to users. Assign them only to groups.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This will simplify the maintenance, as the number of groups is much smaller than the number of users, and also less volatile.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>If you want a group/user to be able only to modify pages, do not grant them create or deny rights. Only grant them modify and read rights.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Use Deny sparingly. As far as possible use only Allow.</p> <p>Using deny can cause unexpected effects if the permissions are applied in a different order than the order expected. If a user is a member of more than one group, the Deny statements from one group may cancel the Allow statement from another group or vice versa. It is hard to keep an overview when this happens and can easily lead to unforeseen results, whereas Allow assignments do not cause such conflicts.</p> <p>Adobe recommends that you work with Allow rather than Deny see <a href="#bestpractices">Best Practices</a>.</p> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Before modifying either permission, be sure you understand how they work and inter-relate. See the CRX documentation to illustrate how AEM WCM <a href="../../../sites/administering/using/user-group-ac-admin.md#howaccessrightsareevaluated">evaluates access rights</a> and examples on setting up access control lists.</p>

  <p>This allows the impersonator accounts to complete tasks as if they were using the account they are impersonating; for example, during an absence or to share an excessive load short-term.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>In order for impersonating to work for non-admin users, the impersonator (in the above case user-B) is required to have READ permissions in the <span class="code">/home/users</span> path.</p> 
   <p>For more information on how to achieve this, see <a href="../../../sites/administering/using/security.md#permissionsinaem">Permissions in AEM</a>.<br /> </p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p>If one account impersonates another it is very difficult to see. An entry is made in the audit log when the impersonation starts and ends, but the other log files (such as the access log) hold no information about the fact that impersonation has occurred on the events. So if user-B is impersonating user-A all events will look as if they were performed by user-A personally.</p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p>Locking a page can be performed when impersonating a user. However a page locked in this way can only then be unlocked as the user who was impersonated or a user with administrator privileges.</p> 
   <p>Pages can not be unlocked by impersonating the user who locked the page.<br /> </p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Best Practices</h3> 
  <p>The following describes best practices when working with permissions and privileges:</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Rule</td> 
     <td>Reason</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><i>Use Groups</i>.</td> 
     <td><p>Avoid assigning access rights on a user-by-user basis. There are several reasons for this:</p> <li><p>You have many more users than groups, so groups simplify the structure.</p> </li> <li><p>Groups help provide an overview over all accounts.</p> </li> <li><p>Inheritance is simpler with groups.</p> </li> <li><p>Users come and go. Groups are long-term.</p> </li> </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><i>Be Positive.</i></td> 
     <td><p>Always use Allow statements to specify the group’s rights (wherever possible). Avoid using a Deny statement.</p> <p>Groups are evaluated in order, and the order may be defined differently per user.</p> <p>In other words: You may have little control over the order in which the statements are implemented and evaluated. If you use only Allow statements, the order does not matter.</p> </td>

  <h2>Managing Users and Groups</h2> 
  <p>Users include people using the system and foreign systems making requests to the system.</p> 
  <p>A group is a set of users.</p> 
  <p>Both can be configured using the User Administration functionality within the Security Console.</p> 
  <h3>Accessing User Administration with the Security Console</h3> 
  <p>You access all users, groups, and associated permissions using the Security console. All the procedures described in this section are performed in this window.</p> 
  <p>To access AEM WCM security, do one of the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>From the Welcome screen or various locations in AEM, click the security icon:<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/wcmtoolbar.png" /> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Navigate directly to <span class="code">http://&amp;lt;server&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;/useradmin</span>. Be sure you log into AEM as an administrator.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The following window displays:</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecuritypage.png" /> 
  <p>The left tree lists all the users and groups currently in the system. You can select the columns you want displayed, sort the contents of the columns, and even change the order in which the columns are displayed by dragging the column-header to a new position.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecuritycolumncontext.png" /> 
  <p>The tabs provide access to various configurations:</p> 
  <draft-comment lastModifiedBy="admin" lastModifiedDate="2017-11-30T05:01:53.991-0500" prevFirstName="unknown" prevLastName="Administrator" type="remark"> 
   <p>this table contains many (if not all, havent checked in detail) invalid links like http://security.html#Impersonating%20Users</p> 
   <p>my guess is that these links should be anchors instead. will start replacing them (sspycher) </p>

  <h3>Filtering Users and Groups</h3> 
  <p>You can filter the list by entering a filter expression, which hides all the users and groups that do not match the expression. You can also hide users and groups by using the <a href="#hidingusersandgroups">Hide User and Hide Group</a> buttons. </p> 
  <p>To filter users or groups:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the left tree list, type your filter expression in the space provided. For example, entering <strong>admin</strong> displays all users and groups containing this string.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the magnifying glass to filter the list.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecurityfilter.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>x</strong> when you want to remove all filters.<br /> </p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Hiding Users and Groups</h3> 
  <p>Hiding users or groups is another way to filter the list of all users and groups in a system. There are two toggle mechanisms. Clicking Hide User hides all users from view and clicking Hide Groups hides all groups from view (you cannot hide both users and groups at the same time). To filter the list by using a filter expression, see <a href="security#Filtering%20Users%20and%20Groups">Filtering users and groups</a>.</p> 
  <p>To hide users and groups:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console, click <strong>Hide Users</strong> or <strong>Hide Groups</strong>. The selected button appears highlighted.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecurityhideusers.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>To make either users or groups reappear, click the corresponding button again.<br /> </p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Creating Users and Groups</h3> 
  <p>To create a new user or group:<br /> </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console tree list, click <strong>Edit</strong> and then either <strong>Create User</strong> or <strong>Create Group</strong>.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqseruityeditcontextmenu.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Enter the required details, according to whether you are creating a user or a group.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>If you select <strong>Create User,</strong> you enter the Login ID, first and last name, e-mail address and a password. By default, AEM creates a path based on the first letter of the last name, but you can select another path.<br /> </li> 
    </ul> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/createuserdialog.png" /> 
    <ul> 
     <li>If you select <strong>Create Group</strong>, you enter a group ID and an optional description.</li> 
    </ul> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/creategroupdialog.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Create</strong>. The user or group you created appears in the tree list.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Deleting Users and Groups</h3> 
  <p>To delete a user or group:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console, select the user or group you want to delete. If you want to delete multiple items, Shift+click or Control+click to select them.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Edit,</strong> then select Delete. AEM WCM asks whether you want to delete the user or group.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click<strong> OK</strong> to confirm or Cancel to cancel your action.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Modifying User and Group Properties</h3> 
  <p>To modify user and group properties:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console, double-click the user or group name you want to modify.<br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Properties</strong> tab, make the required changes, and click <strong>Save</strong>.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecurityuserprops.png" /></li> 
  </ol> 
  <note> 
   <p>The path of the user is displayed at the bottom of the user properties. It cannot be modified.<br /> </p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Changing a User Password</h3> 
  <p>Use the following procedure to modify a user's password.<br /> </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>You cannot use the Security console to change the admin password. To change the password for the admin account, use the <a href="../../../sites/administering/using/granite-user-group-admin.md#main-pars-title-9">Users console</a> that Granite Operations provides. </p> 
   <p> </p> 
   <p> </p> 
  </note> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console, double-click the user name you want to change the password for.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Properties</strong> tab (if not already active).<br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Set Password</strong>. The Set Password window opens where you can change your password.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecurityuserpassword.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Enter the new password twice; as they are not displayed in clear text this is for confirmation - if they do not match, the system shows an error.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Set</strong> to activate the new password for the account.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Adding Users or Groups to a Group</h3> 
  <p>AEM offers three different ways to add users or groups to an existing group:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>When you are in the group, you can add members (either users or groups).</li> 
   <li>When you are in the member, you can add members to groups.</li> 
   <li>When you are working on Permissions, you can add members to groups.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Groups - Adding Users or Groups to a Group</h4>

  </ol> 
  <h3>User Synchronization</h3> 
  <p>When the deployment is a <a href="../../../sites/deploying/using/recommended-deploys.md#tarmkfarm">publish farm</a>, users and groups need to be synchronized among all publish nodes. </p> 
  <p>To learn about user sync and how to enable it, see <a href="../../../sites/administering/using/sync.md">User Sychronization</a>.</p> 
  <h2>Managing Permissions</h2> 
  <p>This section describes how to set permissions, including replication privileges.<br /> </p> 
  <h4>Setting Permissions</h4> 
  <p>Permissions allow users to perform certain actions on resources at certain paths. It also includes the ability to create or delete pages.<br /> </p> 
  <p>To add, modify, or delete permissions:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Security</strong> console, double-click the name of the user or group you want to set permissions for or <a href="#searchingfornodes">search for nodes</a>.<br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cquserpermissions.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>In the tree grid, select a check box to allow the selected user or group to perform an action or clear a check box to deny the selected user or group to perform an action. For more information click <strong>Details</strong>.<br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>When finished, click <strong>Save</strong>.<br /> </p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Setting Replication Privileges</h4> 
  <p>Replication privilege is the right to publish content, and it can be set for groups and users.</p> 
  <note> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Any replication rights applied to a group apply to all the users in that group.</li> 
    <li>A user's replication privileges supersedes a group's replication privileges.</li> 
    <li>The Allow replication rights have a higher precedence than the Deny replication rights. See <a href="#permissionsinaem">Permissions in AEM</a> for more information.</li> 
   </ul> 
  </note> 
  <p>To set replication privileges:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Select the user or group from the list, double-click to open, and click <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>In the grid, navigate to the path where you want the user to have replication privileges or <a href="#searchingfornodes">search for nodes.</a><br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>In the <strong>Replicate</strong> column at the path selected, select a check box to add the replication privilege for that user or group, or clear the check box to remove the replication privilege. AEM displays a red triangle anywhere you have made changes that have not yet been saved.<br /> </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cquserreplicatepermissions.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save your changes.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>Searching for nodes</h3> 
  <p>When adding or removing permissions, you can either browse or search for the node.</p> 
  <p>There are two different types of path search:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Path search - If the search string starts with a "/" then the search will search for the direct sub-nodes of the given path:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecuritypathsearch.png" /> 
  <p>In the search box, you can do the following:<br /> </p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Right arrow key<br /> </td> 
     <td>Selects a sub-node in the search result</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Down arrow key </td> 
     <td>Starts the search again. </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Enter (Return) key </td> 
     <td>Selects a subnode and loads it in the treegrid</td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <ul> 
   <li>FullText search - If the search string does not start with a "/" then a fulltext search is executed on all the nodes under the path "/content."</li> 
  </ul> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecurityfulltextsearch.png" /> 
  <p>To perform a search on paths or fulltext:<br /> </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the Security console, select a user or group and then click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.<br /> </p> </li> 
   <li><p>In the Search box, enter a term to search for.<br /> </p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Impersonating Users</h4> 
  <p>You can specify one or more users that are allowed to impersonate the current user. This means they can switch their account settings to those of the current user and act on behalf of this user.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Use this function with caution as it may allow users to perform actions that their own user cannot. When impersonating a user, users are notified that they are not logged in as themselves.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>There are various scenarios when you may want to use this functionality, including:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>If you are out of the office, you can let another person impersonate you while you are away. By using this feature, you can make sure that somebody has your access rights and you do not need to modify a user profile or give out your password.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>You can use it for debugging purposes. For example, to see how the Web site looks for a user with restricted access rights. Also, if a user complains about technical problems, you can impersonate that user to diagnose and fix the problem.</p> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>To impersonate an existing user:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>In the tree list, select the name of the person who you want to assign other users to impersonate. Double-click to open.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Impersonators</strong> tab.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the user you want to be able to impersonate the selected user. Drag the user (who will impersonate) from the list to the Impersonate pane. The name appears in the list.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-438.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br /> </p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Setting User and Group Preferences</h4> 
  <p>To set user and group preferences, including language, window management, and toolbar preferences:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>Select the user or group whose preferences you want to change in the left-hand tree. To select multiple users or groups, Ctrl+click or Shift+click your selections.</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Preferences</strong> tab.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/cqsecuritypreferences.png" /></li> 
   <li><p>Make changes, as necessary to the group or user preferences and click <strong>Save</strong> when finished.</p> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h4>Setting users or administrators to have the privilege to manage other users</h4>

  <h3>Extending Privileges on a Project Level</h3> 
  <p>If you plan to implement application-specific privileges, the following information describes what you need to know to implement a custom privilege and how to enforce it throughout CQ:</p> 
  <p>The hierarchy-modification privilege is covered by a combination of jcr-privileges. The replication privilege is named <strong>crx:replicate</strong> that is stored/evaluated along with other privileges on the jcr repository. It is, however, not enforced on the jcr level.</p> 
  <p>The definition and registration of custom privileges is officially part of the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-api/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/api/security/authorization/PrivilegeManager.java">Jackrabbit API</a> as of version 2.4 (see also <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-2887">JCR-2887</a>). Further usage is covered by JCR Access Control Management such as definedby <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a> (section 16). In addition, the Jackrabbit API defines a couple of extensions.</p> 
  <p>The privilege registration mechanism is reflected in the UI under <strong>Repository Configuration</strong>. </p> 
  <p>The registration of new (custom) privileges is itself protected by a built-in privilege that must be granted on the repository level (in JCR: passing 'null' as the 'absPath' parameter in the ac mgt api, see jsr 333 for details). By default, <strong>admin</strong> and all members of administrators have that privilege granted.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>While the implementation takes care of validating and evaluating custom privileges, it cannot enforce them unless they are aggregates of built-in privileges.</p>
