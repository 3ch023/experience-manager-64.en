# Working with Adobe Campaign{#working-with-adobe-campaign}

Adobe Campaign is a set of solutions that lets you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels.

This documentation describes how to work with Adobe Campaign:

* Adobe Campaign 6.1, which is the on-premise solution. 
* Adobe Campaign Standard, which is the subscription-based solution.

See the following:

* [Working with Adobe Campaign 6.1 and Adobe Campaign Standard](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-ac-campaign.md)

* [Targeting your Adobe Campaign](../../../sites/classic-ui-authoring/using/classic-personalization-ac-target.md)

You must previously have [integrated AEM with Adobe Campaign](../../../sites/administering/using/campaign.md).
