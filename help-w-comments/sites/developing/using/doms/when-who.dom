     <td>Quality Assurance Team</td> 
     <td><p>You will need a Quality Assurance Team (of whatever size appropriate) for functional and performance tests.</p> <p>These are neutral, dedicated testers - a golden rule of software always states that a developer should never test their own work.</p> <p>The members of this team may be drawn from the Day project team, the partner and/or your customer team.</p> </td> 
     <td><p>The first function release should be made available to the testers (as soon as is realistically possible). Although an early interim release may generate a lot of bugs, it can provide early feedback on critical issues.</p> </td>

     <td>Customer Test Team</td> 
     <td><p>Depending on the Project Model selected it may be planned for members of the customer team to be involved in testing, in particular authors from the customer site.</p> <p>The is advantageous as it:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><p>Provides the customer with experience of the project being developed.</p> </li> 
       <li><p>Provides early feedback from the customer.</p> </li> 
       <li><p>Users often express their requirements in terms of past experience; involving the customers in testing as early as possible increases their experience of the new project in terms of <i>hands-on</i> experience.</p> </li> 
      </ul> </td> 
     <td><p>Again early involvement is good, though any release the customers use should be stable, with reasonable functionality.</p> <p>First impressions are always important.</p> </td>
