# Tracking results and providing feedback{#tracking-results-and-providing-feedback}

How and where you define the test cases, and the resulting test plan, is at your own discretion; there are many tools available.

However, regardless of the method or tool you choose, the information stored:

* Should be:

    * Limited to tracking the test case and its results. This ensures that maintenance remains straightforward, and the document can provide a clear overview of the testing progress.
    * Maintained as a single copy, available to all appropriate members of the project team.
    * Neutral and limited to the test results. It is the responsibility of the project manager to make decisions on any actions resulting from the test results.

* Should not be:

    * Extended to include tracking information - neither bugs, new features nor follow-on actions. This information should be maintained elsewhere, again there are many tools available.
