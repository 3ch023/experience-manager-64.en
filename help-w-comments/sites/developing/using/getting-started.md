## Core Concepts {#core-concepts}

The tutorial implementation will only work as-is on AEM 6.4, however many of the topics apply to all versions of AEM. The site will be implemented using:

* [HTL](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/htl/user-guide.html)
* [Sling Models](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/models.html)
* [Touch UI](../../../sites/developing/using/touch-ui-concepts.md)
* [Core Components](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/core-components/user-guide.html)
* [Editable Templates](../../../sites/developing/using/page-templates-editable.md)

Please progress through the tutorial before diving into the above concepts in detail.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

Once you have completed the [tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/sites/using/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop.html), consider reviewing the document [AEM Core Concepts](../../../sites/developing/using/the-basics.md) to get a better understanding of some of the underlying technologies and development paradigms of AEM.
