# REDIRECT Core Components{#redirect-core-components}

In Adobe Experience Manager, components are the structural elements that constitute the content of the pages being authored. This section covers the core components, which provide essential content types to create pages.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Core components are not immediately available to authors, the [development team must first integrate them to your environment](/content/help/en/experience-manager/core-components/using/using). Once integrated, they may be made available and pre-configured via the [template editor](../../../sites/authoring/using/templates.md) or in [design mode](../../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-designmode.md).

## Authoring with Core Components {#authoring-with-core-components}

Authoring with the core components does not differ substantially from the [foundation components](../../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-foundation.md).

However, as an author, you will notice several advantages of the core components, including:

* Simple to use and well-integrated to the page editor
* Feature-rich capabilities to accomodate many use cases as [illustrated in We.Retail](../../../sites/developing/using/we-retail.md)
* Pre-configurable to define which features are available to page authors
* Built around accessibility guidelines  
* Built to support responsive layout

## Compatibility and Documentation {#compatibility-and-documentation}

The core components were introduced with AEM 6.3 and offer flexible and feature-rich authoring functionality. The [We.Retail reference site](../../../sites/developing/using/we-retail.md) illustrates how the core components can be used.

Core components have a separate release cycle from AEM and therefore different AEM versions can support different releases of the core components. Visit the [core components versions](/content/help/en/experience-manager/core-components/using/versions) page for more information.

>[!CAUTION]

>Core components do not work with the Classic UI.
