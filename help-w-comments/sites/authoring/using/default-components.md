# Components{#components}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) comes with a variety of out-of-the-box components that provide comprehensive functionality for website authors. They are available when [editing a page](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md) and are grouped by main functional area (called component group) to aid filtering.

The components are available when [editing a page](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md). To aid filtering, the components are grouped by main functional area (i.e. component group).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This section only discusses components that are available out-of-the-box in a standard AEM installation.
>
>Depending on your instance you may have customized components developed explicitly for your requirements. These may even have the same name as some of the components discussed here.

## General Usage {#general-usage}

The components are available on the **Components** tab of the side panel of the page editor when [editing a page](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md).

You can select a component and drag it to the required location on your page. You can then edit it using:

* [Configure Properties](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-page-properties.md)
* [Edit Content](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md)  

* [Edit Content - Full Screen Mode](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md#main-pars-title-31)

For further information about adding components to a page see the article [Editing Page Content](../../../sites/authoring/using/editing-content.md).  
Components are sorted according to various categories called component groups. Examples of such component groups include:

* **We.Retail**: Includes the core components proxied for use with the [We.Retail reference implementation](../../../sites/developing/using/we-retail.md).  

* **We.Retail Commerce**: Includes commerce components such as carts and product grids  

* **General**: Includes the layout container and experience fragment

## Overview of All Components {#overview-of-all-components}

The [Components Console](../../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-console.md) gives an overview of the component groups, and components, that are provided by your AEM installation. You can view key information about the individual components and their usage.

## Components - Major Areas {#components-major-areas}

The following pages provide links to some of additional, important information about components:

* [Core Components](/content/help/en/experience-manager/core-components/user-guide) - The Core Components offer flexible and feature-rich authoring functionality, which provide essential content types to create pages.  

* [Communities](../../../communities/using/author-communities.md) - Components provide interactive features for a website, such as forums and comments. Many of these components are included when a [Community Site](../../../communities/using/overview.md) is created.  

* [eCommerce](../../../sites/administering/using/ecommerce.md) - The eCommerce functionality within AEM also includes a range of components. Actual use can depend on the commerce engine being used.

### Configuring Components {#configuring-components}

In addition to the components that authors can access in a standard installation, various other components are also available.

* If your page is based on the recommended, modern, editable template, you can [edit the template](../../../sites/authoring/using/templates.md) enable/disable these and edit parameters for specific components.
* If your page is based on a static template, you can use [design mode](../../../sites/authoring/using/default-components-designmode.md#main-pars-title-3) to enable/disable these and edit parameters for specific components.
