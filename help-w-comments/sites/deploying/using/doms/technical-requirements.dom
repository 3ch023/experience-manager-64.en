  <h3>Virtual &amp; Cloud Computing Environments</h3> 
  <p>Adobe Experience Manager is supported running in a virtual machine on cloud computing environments, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), in compliance with the technical requirements listed on this page, and according to Adobe’s standard support terms.</p> 
  <p>Adobe recommends using Adobe Managed Services to deploy AEM on Azure or AWS. Adobe Managed Services provides experts with experience and skills of deploying and operating AEM in these cloud computing environments. Please check out our <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management/managed-services-cloud-platform.html?aemClk=t" target="_blank">additional documentation on Adobe Managed Services</a>.</p> 
  <p>In all other cases of deploying AEM on Azure or AWS, or any other cloud computing environment, support from Adobe will be contained to the virtual compute environment in compliance with the technical specifications listed on this page. Any reported issue relative to AEM running in any of these cloud environments will need to be reproducible independently from any cloud service specific to the cloud computing environment, unless the cloud service is specifically supported as part of the technical requirements listed on this page, for example Azure Blob storage or AWS S3.</p> 
  <p>For recommendations on how to deploy AEM on Azure or AWS, outside of Adobe Managed Services, we strongly recommend working directly with the cloud provider or Adobe partners supporting the deployment of AEM in the cloud environment of your choice. The selected cloud provider or partner will be responsible for the sizing specifications, design and implementation of the architecture., to meet your specific performance, load, scalability, and security requirements.</p> 
  <h3>Dispatcher Platforms (Web Servers)</h3> 
  <p>The Dispatcher is the caching and load balancing component. <a href="/content/help/en/experience-manager/dispatcher/release-notes">Download the latest Dispatcher version</a>. Experience Manager 6.4 requires Dispatcher version 4.3.1 or higher.</p>

    <ol> 
     <li>The HTTP server was built using only official Apache source distributions, or</li> 
     <li>The HTTP server was delivered as part of the operating system on which it is running. Examples: IBM HTTP Server, Oracle HTTP Server<br /> </li>

  <h3>Supported Browsers for Websites</h3> 
  <p>Generally, browser support for websites rendered by AEM Sites depends on the implementation of AEM page templates, design and component output, and is therefore in control of the party implementing these parts.</p> 
  <draft-comment type="draft"> 
   <note type="note"> 
    <p>Some browser-related exceptions for mobile clients are as listed below. These exceptions are only for AEM Forms:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Forms Portal is supported on Safari on iPad only.</li> 
     <li>Blackberry browser supports only adaptive forms.</li> 
    </ul>

  <h3>WebDAV Clients</h3> 
  <p><strong>Microsoft Windows 7+</strong><br /> </p> 
  <p>To successfully connect with Microsoft Windows 7+ to an AEM instance that is not secured with SSL, basic authentication over unsecured network must be enabled in Windows. This requires a change in the Windows Registry of the WebClient:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Locate the registry subkey: 
    <ul> 
     <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>Add the BasicAuthLevel registry entry to this subkey using a value of 2 or more.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/841215">Microsoft Support KB 841215</a>.</p> 
  <p>To improve responsivness of the WebDav Client under Windows - see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2445570">Microsoft Support KB 2445570</a></p> 
  <h2>Additional Platform Notes</h2> 
  <p>This section provides special notes and more detailed information about running Adobe Experience Manager and its add-ons.</p> 
  <h3>IPv4 and IPv6</h3> 
  <p>All elements of Adobe Experience Manager (Instance, Dispatcher) can be installed in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.</p> 
  <p>Operation is seamless as no special configuration is required. You can simply specify an IP address using the format that is appropriate to your network type, if neccessary.</p> 
  <p>This means that when an IP address needs to be specified you can select (as required) from:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>an IPv6 address<br /> for example <span class="code">http://[ab12::34c5:6d7:8e90:1234]:4502</span><br /> </li> 
   <li>an IPv4 address<br /> for example <span class="code">http://123.1.1.4:4502</span><br /> </li> 
   <li>a server name<br /> for example, <span class="code">http://www.yourserver.com:4502</span></li> 
   <li>the default case of <span class="code">localhost</span> will be interpreted for both IPv4 and IPv6 network installations<br /> for example, <span class="code">http://localhost:4502</span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Requirements for AEM Dynamic Media Add-on</h3> 
  <p>AEM Dynamic Media is disabled by default. See here to <a href="../../../assets/using/config-dynamic.md#enablingdynamicmedia">enable Dynamic Media</a>.</p> 
  <p>With Dynamic Media enabled, the following additional technical requirements apply.<br /> </p> 
  <note> 
   <p>These system requirements <strong>only</strong> apply if you use Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode; Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode has an embedded image server, which is only certified on certain operating systems. </p> 
   <p>For Dynamic Media customers who run Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode (that is, <strong>dynamicmedia_scene7</strong> runmode), there are no additional system requirements; only the same system requirements as AEM. Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode architecture uses the cloud-based image service, not the service embedded in AEM.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h4>Hardware</h4> 
  <p>The following hardware requirements are applicable for both Linux and Windows:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron CPU with at least 4 cores<br /> </li> 
   <li>16GB of RAM minimum</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Linux</h4> 
  <p>If you are using Dynamic Media on Linux, the following prerequisites need to be met: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>RedHat Enterprise 7 or CentOS 7 and later with latest fix patches</li> 
   <li>64-bit Operating System</li> 
   <li>Swapping disabled (recommended)</li> 
   <li>SELinux disabled (See note that follows)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <note> 
   <p>If the locale is set such that LC_CTYPE is not equal to en_US.UTF-8, it will prevent dynamic media from working. To see what its value is type "locale" at the command prompt. If it not set to that, then set the LC_CTYPE environment variable to the empty string by typing "export LC_CTYPE=" before running AEM.</p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p><strong>Disabling SELinux:</strong> Image Serving does not work with SELinux turned on. This option is enabled by default. To remedy this issue, edit the <strong>/etc/selinux/config</strong> file and change the SELinux value from:</p> 
   <p><span class="code">SELINUX=enforcing</span><strong> </strong>to<strong> </strong><span class="code">SELINUX=disabled</span></p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p><strong>NUMA Architecture:</strong> Systems with processors featuring AMD64 and Intel EM64T are typically configured as non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) platforms, which means that the kernel constructs multiple memory nodes at boot-time rather than constructing a single memory node.</p> 
   <p>The multiple node construct can result in memory exhaustion on one or more of the nodes before other nodes become exhausted. When memory exhaustion happens the kernel can decide to kill processes (for example, the Image Server or Platform Server) even though there is available memory.</p> 
   <p>Therefore, Adobe recommends that if you are running such a system that you turn off NUMA using the <strong>numa=off</strong> boot option to avoid the kernel killing these processes.</p> 
  </note> 
  <note> 
   <p><strong>Hostname of server must be resolvable:</strong> Make sure that the hostname of the server is resolvable to an IP address. If that is not possible, please add the fully qualified hostname and the IP address to <strong>/etc/hosts</strong>:</p> 
   <p><span class="code">&amp;lt;ip address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fully qualified hostname&amp;gt;</span></p> 
  </note> 
  <h4>Windows</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Microsoft Windows Server 2016</li> 
   <li>Swap space equal to at least twice the amount of physical memory (RAM)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>To use Dynamic Media on Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, 2013, and 2015 redistributables for x64 and x86 must be installed.</p> 
  <p>x64</p>
