  <p>Components are the fundamental elements of the AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) experience. You can use a number of components and add it to your channel in an AEM Screens project.</p> 
  <h2>Components in AEM Screens</h2> 
  <p>AEM Screens provide different AEM components that can be used in a Screens project.</p> 
  <h3>Viewing AEM Screens Components</h3> 
  <p>Whenever you create an AEM Screens project, you will see a list of default components that can be added to the project.</p> 
  <p>To view the default components to your Screens project, follow the steps below:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Select the channel. For example, <strong>We.Retail In Store</strong> --&amp;gt; <strong>Channels</strong> --&amp;gt; <strong>Idle Channel</strong>.</li> 
   <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> from the action bar to open the AEM editor.</li> 
   <li>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the side bar to open the components.</li> 
   <li>All the components that are included by default in an AEM Screens project displays, as shown in the figure below.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/screen_shot_2017-12-18at21350pm.png" /> 
  <h3>Adding a New Component</h3> 
  <p>AEM provides a number of other components. You can always add other components (not included by default) to your project, given that those are compatible with AEM Screens.</p> 
  <p>The following example shows the addition of a Livefyre component to a an AEM Screens project:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Select the channel where you want to add a new component. For example, <strong>We.Retail In Store</strong> --&amp;gt; <strong>Channels</strong> --&amp;gt; <strong>Idle Channel</strong>.</li> 
   <li>Click<strong> Edit f</strong>rom the action bar to open the editor.</li> 
   <li> Select <strong>Design</strong> mode.</li> 
   <li>Select the entire design editor on the right and click on the settings symbol to open the <strong>ParSys Design</strong> dialog box.</li> 
   <li>You can select the components that you want to import to your AEM Screens project. The following example shows the the addition of <strong>Livefyre</strong> component to an AEM Screens project. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/adding_components.gif" /> 
  <note> 
   <p>Similarly, you can add any number of other new components that are compatible with AEM Screens to your project.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h2>Understanding AEM Screen Components</h2> 
  <p>The following section explains the AEM Screens components' that you can use in your project.</p> 
  <note> 
   <p>To view the properties of any component, select the component and click on the hammer icon to open/view properties.</p> 
  </note> 
  <h3>Application</h3> 
  <p>The <strong>Application</strong> component allows you to add an application to your channel.</p> 
  <p>Application component has the following properties:</p> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong>Property</strong></td> 
     <td><strong>Description</strong></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong><em>Application Path</em></strong></td> 
     <td>Select the absolute path where the application exists.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong><em>Duration (ms)</em></strong></td> 
     <td>Select the duration of the application. By default, the duration is set to -1, that means the element runs forever (that is, single page application). Setting the duration value &gt;0, shows the element for the specified duration and then moves on to the next one.</td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <p>The following example shows how to embedd an application component along with the preview of its properties:</p>

    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong><em>Duration (ms)</em></strong></td>

    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td><strong><em>Strategy</em></strong></td> 
     <td>Set it to <strong>original</strong> or <strong>single</strong>. Setting the value to <strong>original</strong> means that the subsequence will run fully on each cycle of the parent sequence. The other possible value is <strong>single</strong> and that would only show one item of the subsequence on each run (for instance, the 1st item on the first loop, 2nd item on the second loop, and so on.)</td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <h3>Dynamic Embedded Sequence</h3>
