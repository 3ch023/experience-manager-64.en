**Firmware** Firmware is the term given to the software that runs on the device inside the player application in a web view. It is a javascript layer that runs the content contained in a channel within iFrames and provides access to native capabilities through plugins. The firmware can be updated without updating the player application.

**Live Copy** A Live Copy is a copy of specific site content for which a live relationship with the original source is maintained. This live relationship allows the live copy to inherit content and page properties from the source.

**Location** Locations host the configuration of the displays according to where the various screens are.
