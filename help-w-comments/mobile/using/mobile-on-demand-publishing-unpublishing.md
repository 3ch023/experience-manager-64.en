# Publish UnPublish Content{#publish-unpublish-content}

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](../../sites/developing/using/spa-overview.md).

Once you are familiar with content management actions on articles, banners, and collections you can publish your content. Also you can unpublish your content.

## Publishing/Unpublishing the Content {#publishing-unpublishing-the-content}

This differs from an "AEM Publish". We are not pushing content to an AEM Publish server instance to make it publicly viewable. Here, we are informing Mobile On-Demand that the selected content should be made public within the live Mobile On-Demand app.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Content must be uploaded to Mobile On-Demand before it can be published.

The general workflow to publish/unpublish an article:

1. From Mobile, choose your Mobile On-Demand app from the catalog.
1. Select an article.
1. Add additional articles if needed from the list view.
1. Select Publish from the action bar. After a few moments, your articles will now be public.
1. Use the same steps above to Unpublish publish articles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Generally, you should preflight before publishing. See [Previewing with Preflight](/content/docs/en/aem/6-3/administer/mobile-apps/aem-mobile/previewing-with-preflight-on-demand-services) for more details.
