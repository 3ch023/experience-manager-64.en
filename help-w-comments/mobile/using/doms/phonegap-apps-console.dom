  <p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The AEM mobile application development process recognizes that users of different expertise contribute to the development of mobile applications. The following process map illustrates the general order in which content authors and application developers perform tasks.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-10.gif" />
  <p>Information about how to perform the Marketer tasks appear on this page. For information about the Developer tasks, see Building PhoneGap Applications. </p> 
  <h2>The Structure of Mobile Applications</h2>
  <p>AEM Mobile provides the Phonegap App blueprint for creating mobile applications. The blueprint defines the structure of the applications that you create. Applications consist of the following items:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The root page.</li> 
   <li>The language variations of the application.</li> 
   <li>The home page of the language variation.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>The Root of a Phonegap App</h3>
  <p>The root page of the mobile applications that you create in AEM appears in the Apps console. </p> 
  <p>The root page is stored below the Destination Path property of the application that was specified upon creating the application (the default path is /content/phonegap/apps). The page name is the Name property of the application. For example, the default URL of the root page of the site named <span class="code">myphonegapapp</span> is <span class="code">http://localhost:4502/content/phonegap/apps/myphonegapapp.html</span>.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-153.png" />
  <h3>The Language Variation of a PhoneGap App</h3>
  <p>The first child pages of the root page are the language variations of the application. The name of each page is the language for which the application is created. For example, English is the name of the English variation of the application.</p> 
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The default PhoneGap blueprint creates only an English application. Your developer can modify the blueprint so that it can create more language variations.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-154.png" />
  <p>The language page serves two purposes:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The page content is the spash page for the language variation of the application.</li> 
   <li>The page properties control several design aspects of the application, such as the URL to use for requesting content updates, and information about connecting to the cloud build and Adobe Analytics Services integration. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-155.png" />
  <h3>The Home Page</h3>
  <p>The Home page, or index.html page of a language variation of an application appears when the application is opened.The home page provides users with a menu of links to various pages in the application. The paragraph system enables you to add components to the page for creating content.</p> 
  <h2>Creating a Mobile Application</h2>
  <p>Mobile applications are based on a blueprint that defines a page structure and properties. You can configure the following application properties:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Title:</strong> The application title.</li> 
   <li><strong>Destination Path:</strong> The location in the repository where the application is stored. Leave the default to create a path based on the app name.<br /> </li> 
   <li><strong>Name:</strong> The default value is the value of the Title property with space characters removed. The name is used within CQ to refer to the application, for example for the repository node that represents the application.</li> 
   <li><strong>Description:</strong> A description of the application.</li> 
   <li><strong>Server URL:</strong> The URL that provides Over-the-Air (OTA) content updates to the application. The default value is the publish server URL of the instance that is used to create an application (taken from the externalizer service). Note, this must be a publish server instance rather than an author, which requires authentication.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div>
   You can also provide an image file to use as the application thumbnail, select the PhoneGap Build configuration to use, and select the Mobile App analytics configuration to use. This image is only used as a thumbnail to represent your mobile application within the mobile apps console in Experience Manager.
  </div> 
  <div> 
  </div> 
  <div>
   Additional (and optional) tabs exist for build cloud service and integrating the Adobe Mobile Services SDK plug-in into your app. 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Build: Click manage configurations and set up your build.phonegap.com build service here. Then from the drop-down you will be able to select the newly created PhoneGap build cloud service.</li> 
   <li>Analytics: Click manage configurations and set up your <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/en_US/get-started/mobile/c-measuring-mobile-applications">Adobe Mobile Services SDK</a> cloud service. Then from the drop-down you will be able to select the newly created Mobile Service to integrate into your mobile app.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <note>
   <p>Developers can use the AEM PhoneGap Starter Kit to create apps and add them to the console.</p> 
  </note>
  <p>The following procedure uses the Touch UI to create a mobile application.</p> 
  <ol>
   <li><p>On the rail, click Apps.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Click or tap the Create icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-156.png" /></li>
   <li><p>(Optional) On the Advanced tab, provide a description for the application, and change the server URL if required.</p> </li>
   <li><p>(Optional) If you are using PhoneGap Build to compile the application, on the Build tab, select the Configuration to use.</p> <p>To create a PhoneGap build configuration, click Manage Configurations.</p> </li>
   <li><p>(Optional) If you are using SiteCatalyst to track application activity, on the Analytics tab, select the configuration to use.</p> <p>To create a Mobile App Configuration, click Manage Configurations.</p> </li>
   <li><p>(Optional) To provide an application icon, click the Browse button, select the image file from your file system, and click Open.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Click Create.</p> </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Changing the Properties of a Mobile Application</h3>
  <p>After you create a mobile application, you can change the properties.</p> 
  <h4>Change the title, description, and icon</h4>
  <ol>
   <li><p>On the rail, click or tap Apps.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Select the application to configure and click the View Page Properties icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-157.png" /></li>
   <li><p>To change property values, click or tap the Edit icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-158.png" /></li>
   <li><p>Configure the Basic and Advanced properties, and then click or tap the Done icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-159.png" /></li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Configure a Language Variation of the Application</h4>
  <ol>
   <li><p>On the rail, click or tap Apps.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Click to drill-into the mobile application you wish to edit within the apps admin console. Select the language version of the application to configure and click the View Application Properties icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-160.png" /></li>
   <li><p>To change property values, click or tap the Edit icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-161.png" /></li>
   <li><p>Configure the properties on the Basic, Advanced, Build, and Analytics tabs, and then click or tap the Done icon.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-162.png" /></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Authoring the Content of a Mobile Application</h3>
  <p>After you create the mobile application, add content that is used as the application UI.</p> 
  <ol>
   <li><p>On the rail, click or tap Apps.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Click or tap the application, then click or tap English. </p> </li>
   <li><p>Edit the Home page, or add child pages as required.</p> </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Moving Content to Mobile Applications</h3>
  <p>The Content Sync cache on the AEM publish instance is used as a repository of content for mobile applications:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Content in the Content Sync cache is included in the application when developers compile the application.</li> 
   <li>Content in the cache is available to installed mobile applications for updating the application content.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Mobile applications include an Updates command that downloads and installs updated application content. When an application instance sends an Update request, Content Sync determines which content has changed since the last time the application was updated or installed, and provides the new content.</p> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-163.png" />
  <p>To make updated content available to applications, you update the Content Sync cache. The first time you update the cache, all published content is added. Subsequent updates adds only the published content that has changed since the previous update. </p> 
  <p>Content Sync also tracks when the updates occur. With this information, Content Sync can determine which cache update to send to a mobile application.</p> 
  <p>Perform the following procedure on the instance where you want to update the cache. For example, if your application requests updates from the publish instance, perform the procedure on the publish instance.</p> 
  <ol>
   <li><p>On the rail, click or tap Apps, then click or tap your application.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Select the splash page, and then click or tap the Update Cache icon. </p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-164.png" /></li>
  </ol>
  <draft-comment type="draft">
   <ol>
    <li><p>On the AEM publish instance, open the Content Sync console. (<a href="http://localhost:4503/libs/cq/contentsync/content/console.html">http://localhost:4503/libs/cq/contentsync/content/console.html</a>)</p> <p>If the Geometrixx sample web sites are installed on the publish instance, you will have to log in to Geometrixx before opening the Content Sync console.</p> </li>
    <li><p>Select your mobile application and click Update Cache.</p> <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-165.png" /><p>When the update completes, the Last Updated date and time is updated.</p> </li>
   </ol>
  </draft-comment>
  <h3>Using App Templates</h3>
  <p>This is a feature that is available with Apps 6.1 Feature Pack 2 and provides an easy way to leverage existing app templates for the creation of new apps within AEM. </p> 
  <p>What is an app template? Think of it as a collection of page templates and components that represent a baseline or foundation of an app. <br /> When creating a new app based on the template of another app, you will get an app that has a starting point representative of the app in which it was created from.</p> 
  <p>You must have an existing mobile app template (or an app installed that has an app template) to make use of this feature.</p> 
  <p>The latest AEM Apps 6.1 samples package includes an updated version of the Geometrixx app with an app template. Alternatively, you can install the StarterKit which also provides a template. </p> 
  <p>Steps to creating a new app based on an app template: </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Ensure you have the latest AEM Apps 6.1 feature pack and reference samples packages installed</li> 
   <li>Click on Apps from the left rail. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-2.jpeg" />
  <ol> 
   <li>Click on the + Create button at the top and select Create App.</li> 
   <li>Once you are presented with the list of App Templates, select one: </li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-3.jpeg" />
  <ol> 
   <li>Click Next. </li> 
   <li>Provide an App Id and Title, however you might want to also include a Name and a Description. 
    <ol> 
     <li>Additionally, you can provide a PNG (supported PhoneGap icon format) as an icon by browsing AEM assets.</li> 
     <li>Recall that you can edit all these fields after the app has been created in the Manage App tile. With the exception of the App Id, once the App Id has been set you are unable to change it.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-166.png" />
  <ol> 
   <li>Click the create button, you will be presented with 2 options, either Done (go back to Apps catalog view) or Manage App (opens the app dashboard). </li> 
   <li>Once created, you should see the new app listed in the App catalog: </li> 
  </ol> 
  <img imageRotate="0" src="assets/chlimage_1-4.jpeg" />
  <ol> 
   <li>Click on the app to open it, you have successfully created a new app based on the template of an existing app. <br /> <br /> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <note>
   <p>If you uninstall the Geometrixx Outdoors reference app package from AEM and have an app created based on its template, then that app will not longer be functional. The Geometrixx Outdoors app can be removed, however the app template must remain if it is used by other mobile applications.</p> 
  </note>
