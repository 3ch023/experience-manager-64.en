# Editing App Metadata{#editing-app-metadata}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](../../sites/developing/using/spa-overview.md).

The **Manage App** tile and "Manage App" page provides a means to view and edit application metadata. App metadata is required details for releasing an application to a vendor's store. This may include common metadata, iOS metadata and screenshots. See the [Manage App Tile](../../mobile/using/phonegap-app-details-tile.md) for further details on common and iOS metadata.

## Editing the App Data {#editing-the-app-data}
