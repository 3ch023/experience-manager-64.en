# Starting AEM PhoneGap{#starting-aem-phonegap}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](../../sites/developing/using/spa-overview.md).

For developers, the best place to start is to take a look at the Adobe Expererience Manager Mobile Starterkit in github

https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit

The starterkit will get you going quickly by walking you through the basics of AEM Mobile development, starting with project creation and governance, installing the necessary tooling, defining a Maven archetype, building, deploying and then creating your own experience.

The developers can use this example as a starting point for trying out an AEM Mobile application using PhoneGap. Running through the starterkit and the reference application, will give a solid understanding of the basics to create rich Mobile Applications.

* Use the [AEM PhoneGap Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit) to create apps suitable for the AEM Mobile catalog.
* A [reference app](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-mobile-hybrid-reference) with full source has been created that demonstrates many of the new features in AEM Mobile, whether you are migrating an existing app into AEM Mobile or starting fresh.
* All our samples can be found here on github: [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps) and include bootstrapping your project with Maven.
* Most conference talks will leverage the [Kitchen Sink tutorial](https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink), which you can also find in Github and is focused on the usage of Apache Cordova native extensibility.

>Once you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the starterkit, it is important to learn about Adobe Experience Manager *components and templates.*

### Templates and Components {#templates-and-components}

AEM *Templates* and *Components* enable line of business owners to create custom experiences. Both *Templates *and *Components* are available out-of-the-box or can be custom developed by you, the developer either by extending existing components or creating greenfield (advanced). *Templates* and *Components* are what allow the AEM Author to drag-and-dropped to create engaging and relevent experiences.

1. [Creating Components](../../sites/developing/using/components.md)
1. [Creating Templates](../../sites/developing/using/templates.md)

Once you have a solid understanding of the above two steps, jump into:
