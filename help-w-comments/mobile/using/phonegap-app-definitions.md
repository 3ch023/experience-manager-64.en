App definitions are a way to identify what spaces and other configurations are appropriate for the app. App definitions allows the user to add space, without having to recompile the app. The app definition is updated and that will include the information for any new spaces.

>App definitions are tied to an app, therefore they require the creation of an App in the AEM Mobile App console.
