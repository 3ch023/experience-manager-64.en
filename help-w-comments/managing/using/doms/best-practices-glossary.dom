  </draft-comment> 
  <p>This glossary lists (alpabetically) details of all Deliverable documents from the <a href="../../managing/using/best-practices-checklist.md">Project Checklist</a>.</p> 
  <h3>Acceptance from Business Stakeholders</h3> 
  <p>Acceptance from business stakeholders confirms that they, as key stakeholders, are aligned with the solution and have given their approval as to how the business requirements meet the business case.</p> 
  <h3>Acceptance Tests</h3> 
  <draft-comment color="blue" lastModifiedBy="ims-author-57F1056A4CD116590A746C15@AdobeID" lastModifiedDate="2017-11-30T05:46:45.246-0500" prevFirstName="unknown" prevLastName="unknown" type="remark"> 
   <p>user acceptance tests?</p> 
  </draft-comment> 
  <p>Acceptance testing is performed when an application is ready for production. The tests are performed by a group representing the various types of end-user, using real-life scenarios. </p> 
  <p>Acceptance tests are used to confirm that the:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Project fulfills the customer's requirements.</li> 
   <li>Solution is fit-for-purpose.</li> 
   <li>Users accept the solution and can envisage working with it.</li> 
   <li>Customer accepts the project.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The earlier you plan and design your acceptance tests, the easier the final deployment will be. They should be defined together with the customer and your Quality Assurance team.</p> 
  <p>Although you might not be able to define all details at the very start of the project, initial definitions should be discussed and agreed on. The acceptance tests will probably be based on the fundamental requirements (functional and performance).</p> 
  <h3>Access to Test System Coordinated</h3>

  <h3>Business Requirements Documentation</h3> 
  <p>A business requirements document (BRD) details the business solution for a project, providing a clear specification of the customer's business needs and expectations. The BRD also distinguishes between the business solution and the technical solution.</p> 
  <p>When examining the business solution the BRD should answer the question:<br /> “What does the business want to do?” </p> 
  <h3>Business Sign Off on any Required Adjustments to the Solution or Architecture Identified and Aligned Against ROI and KPI Expectations</h3> 
  <draft-comment color="blue" lastModifiedBy="ims-author-57F1056A4CD116590A746C15@AdobeID" lastModifiedDate="2017-11-30T05:46:46.048-0500" prevFirstName="unknown" prevLastName="unknown" type="remark"> 
   <p>penetration tests don't happen until much later...so how can they be assessed here?</p> 
  </draft-comment> 
  <p>The processes of risk assessment and penetration testing may produce issues and outcomes that need to be addressed in the architecture or development of the solution.</p> 
  <p>Any adjustments resulting from these processes need to be reviewed and approved by the business and gauged against the overall goals.</p> 
  <h3>Caching Strategy</h3>
